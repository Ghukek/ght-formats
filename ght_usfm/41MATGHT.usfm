\c 1
\v 1 [The] origin of{the good-message} of{Jesus Anointed, son} of{the God},
\v 2 as has-been-written in to{the prophets}, "Behold, I am-sending the messenger of{me} before of{[the] face} of{you} who will-equip-ize/furnish the way of{you} in-front of{you}.
\v 3 [The] sound of{crying} in to{the desolate}; prepare the way of{[the] Lord}, be-making straight the paths of{same}."
\v 4 John becomes immersing in to{the desolate} and proclaiming immerse-effect of{change-of-mind/thinking} into let-off/away-sis[i.e. state of release] of{sins},
\v 5 and all the Judea region and the Jerusalemites has-been-being-gone-out toward same, and all have-been-being-immersed in to{the Jordan River} under of{same}, acknowledging-selves-out the sins of{same}.
\v 6 Moreover, John has-been-being having-been-clothed [in] hairs of{camel} and leather belt around the loin of{same} and eating locusts and wild honey,
\v 7 and he-has-been-proclaiming, saying, "The stronger of{me} is-being-come behind of{me}, of{whom} I-am_not_being sufficient, stoop[ing] to-loose the strap of{the footwear} of{same}.
\v 8 I on-one-hand immerse you in to{water}; on-the-other-hand same will-immerse you in to{Holy Spirit},"
\v 9 and it-becomes in to{the-there-s, the days,} Jesus from Nazareth of{the Galilee} comes and is-immersed under of{John} into the Jordan,
\v 10 and straightaway, ascending from of{the water} he-beholds the heavens being-split and the Spirit as-if [a] pigeon/dove descending upon same,
\v 11 and [a] sound becomes out of{the heavens}, "You are-being the Son of{me}, the beloved, in to{whom} I-well-esteem,"
\v 12 and straightaway the Spirit is-casting-out same into the desolate,
\v 13 and he-has-been-being in to{the desolate} forty days, being-trial-ized under of{the Satan/adversary}, and he-has-been-being alongside of{the [wild]animals} and the messengers have-been-serving to{same}.
\v 14 Moreover, alongside the to-be-given-aside/delivered, the John, the Jesus comes into the Galilee, proclaiming the good-message of{the kingdom} of{the God},
\v 15 and saying that "the season has-been-fulfilled and the Kingdom of{the God} has-become-near. Be-changing-minds/thinking and be-believing/entrusting in to{the good-message}."
\v 16 Moreover, walking-around beside the seawater of{the Galilee} he-beholds Simon, and Andrew, the brother of{same}, casting [a] surround-cast[i.e. broad net] in to{the seawater}, for they-have-been-being fishers,
\v 17 and the Jesus says to{same}, "Come!, behind of{me}, and I-will-make you to-become fishers of{men},"
\v 18 and straightaway, let[ing]-off/away-from the nets, they-accompany to{same},
\v 19 and, step[ing]-ahead thence [a] few, he-beholds James, the of{the Zebedee} and John, the brother of{same}, also same in to{the boat}, fit-izing-down/adjusting/equipping the nets,
\v 20 and straightaway he-calls same and, let[ing]-off/away the father of{same}, Zebedee, in to{the boat} alongside of{the hireds}, they-come-off/away behind of{same},
\v 21 and they-are-being-gone-into into Capernaum, and straightaway to{the sabbaths}, come[ing]-into into the gathering[translit. "synagogue"], he-has-been-teaching,
\v 22 and they-have-been-being-impacted upon to{the teaching} of{same}, for he-has-been-being teaching same as having authority and not as the scribes,
\v 23 and [a] man in to{unclean spirit} has-been-being in to{the gathering[translit. "synagogue"]} of{same}, and he-cries-out-up/anew,
\v 24 saying, "Ah!, what[?] to{us} and to{you}, Jesus, Nazarene[?] You-come to-destroy-off/away us[?] I-have-beheld you who are-being the holy of{the God},"
\v 25 and the Jesus adjudges-valuation-upon to{same}, saying, "Be-muzzled and come-out out of{same},"
\v 26 and the spirit, the unclean, convulse[ing] same, and cry[ing]-out to{great sound}, comes-out out of{same},
\v 27 and all are-amazed, such-as to-be-seeking-together toward sameselves, saying, "What[?] is-being the-same[?] Who[?], the teaching, the new, that according-to authority and to{the spirits, the unclean} he-is-setting-upon, and they-are-hearkening-under to{same}[?],"
\v 28 and the heard[noun] of{same} straightaway comes-out into the whole region-around of{the Galilee},
\v 29 and, straightaway come[ing]-out out of{the gathering[translit. "synagogue"]}, they-come into the home of{Simon} and of{Andrew} alongside of{James} and of{John}.
\v 30 Moreover, the mother-in-law of{Simon} has-been-being-lain-down having-fever, and straightaway they-are-saying to{same} about of{same},
\v 31 and, come[ing]-toward, he-rouses same, seize[ing] of{the hand} of{same}, and the fever straightaway lets-off/away-from same, and she-has-been-serving to{same}.
\v 32 Moreover, of{late/evening become[ing]}, when the sun sinks, they-have-been-carrying toward same all the having unwell and the being-demonized,
\v 33 and the whole city has-been-being having-been-gathered-upon toward the entrance,
\v 34 and he-heals many unwell having to{various diseases} and he-casts-out many demons, and he-has_not_been-letting-off the demons to-be-speaking, that they-had-beheld same to-be-being Anointed,
\v 35 and very early/morning in-night, stand[ing]-up/anew, he-comes-out and comes-off/away into [a] desolate place, and-there he-has-been-praying,
\v 36 and the Simon and the alongside of{same} chase-down same
\v 37 and, discover[ing] same, they-are-saying to{same} that "all are-seeking you,"
\v 38 and he-is-saying to{same}, "We-may-be-leading into the being-had village-cities in-which-place also-there I-may-proclaim, for into the-same I-have-come-out,"
\v 39 and he-has-been-being proclaiming in to{the gatherings[translit. "synagogues"]} of{same} into the whole Galilee, and casting-out the demons,
\v 40 and leprous is-being-come toward, calling-aside same and knee-falling same, and saying to{same} that "if-supposing you-may-be-will-ing, you-are-being-empowered to-purge/cleanse me."
\v 41 Moreover, the Jesus, affected-inwardly[i.e. feel[ing] compassion], stretch[ing]-out the hand, takes-hold of{same} and is-saying to{same}, "I-am-will-ing. Be-purged/cleansed,"
\v 42 and, of{say[ing]} of{same}, straightaway the leprosy comes-off/away from of{same} and he-is-purged/cleansed,
\v 43 and, express[ing]-emotion to{same}, straightaway he-casts-out same,
\v 44 and is-saying to{same}, "Be-seeing, to{no-one} nothing you-may-say; contrariwise, be-withdrawing. Show yourself to{the consecrated[i.e. priest]} and carry-toward about of{the purging/cleansing} of{you} which Moses sets-toward into witness to{same}."
\v 45 Moreover, the come[ing]-out initiates to-be-proclaiming much and to-be-through-assert-izing[i.e. spreading] the word, such-as no-still to-be-being-enabled same to-come-into into [the] city revealingly; contrariwise, he-has-been-being outside in to{desolate places}, and they-have-been-being-come toward same from-everywhere,
\c 2
\v 1 and again he-comes-into into Capernaum through of{days} and it-is-heard that he-is-being into [a] house,
\v 2 and straightaway many are-gathered such-as no-still to-be-making-space, nor-moreover the toward the door, and he-has-been-speaking to{same} the word,
\v 3 and they-are-being-come toward same, carrying [a] paralyzed, being-lifted under of{four},
\v 4 and not being-enabled to-become-near-toward to{same} through the crowd, they-off-roof-ize the roof which-where he-has-been-being and, dig[ing]-out, are-loosening/lowering the pallet/bed upon to{which} the paralyzed has-been-being-lain-down.
\v 5 Moreover, the Jesus, behold[ing] the faith of{same[plural]}, is-saying to{the paralyzed}, "Offspring, the sins of{you} have-been-let-off/away to{you}."
\v 6 Moreover, some of{the scribes} have-been-being being-seated there and being-dialog-ized in to{the hearts} of{same},
\v 7 "What[?], the-same, the-same-ly, is-speaking evil-assertion-ias. Who[?] is-being-enabled to-be-letting-off/away sins if not one, the God[?],"
\v 8 and the Jesus, straightaway know[ing]-upon to{the Spirit} of{same} that the-same-ly same[plural] are-being-dialog-ized in to{sameselves}, says to{same}, "What[?] you-are-being-dialog-ized the-same in to{the hearts} of{you}[?]
\v 9 What[?] is-being easier to-say to{the paralyzed}, 'The sins have-been-let-off/away to{you},' or to-say, 'Rouse-self and lift the pallet/bed of{you} and be-walking-around'[?]
\v 10 Moreover, in-which-place you-should-have-beheld that the son of{the man} is-having authority upon of{the earth} to-be-letting-off/away sins," he-is-saying to{the paralyzed},
\v 11 "I-am-saying to{you}, rouse-self and lift the pallet/bed of{you}, and be-withdrawing into the house of{you},"
\v 12 and he-is-roused and, straightaway, lift[ing] the pallet/bed, he-comes-out in-in-place-of[/opposite/facing] of{all} such-as all to-be-astounding/being-astounded and to-be-esteem-izing/glorifying the God, saying that "not-yet-ever the-same-ly we-behold,"
\v 13 and he-comes-out again beside the seawater, and all the crowd has-been-being-come toward same, and he-has-been-teaching same,
\v 14 and, leading-beside, he-beholds Levi, the of{the Alphaeus}, being-seated upon the [tax]collection[place], and he-is-saying to{same}, "Be-accompanying to{me}," and, stand[ing]-up, he-accompanies to{same},
\v 15 and it-becomes in to{the} to-be-being-lain-down same in to{the home} of{same} also many [tax]collectors and sinful have-been-being-lain-up/anew-together to{the Jesus} and to{the disciples} of{same}, for many have-been-being, and they-accompany to{same},
\v 16 and the scribes and the Pharisees, behold[ing] same eating alongside of{the [tax]collectors} and of{sinful} have-been-saying to{the disciples} of{same}, "What[?], that alongside of{the [tax]collectors} and of{sinful} he-is-eating and he-is-drinking,"
\v 17 and the Jesus, hear[ing], is-saying to{same}, "The having-strength are_not_having need of{[a] curer}; contrariwise, the having unwell. I-do_not_come to-call [the] just; contrariwise, [the] sinful into change-of-mind/thinking,"
\v 18 and the disciples of{John} and the of{the Pharisees} have-been-being fasting and they-are-being-come, and they-are-saying to{same}, "Through what[?] the disciples of{John} and the of{the Pharisees} are-fasting; moreover, the disciples to{you} are_not_fasting[?],"
\v 19 and the Jesus says to{same}, "The sons of{the bridechamber}, in to{which} the bridegroom is-being alongside of{same}, are_not_being-enabled to-be-fasting; as-much_time_as they-are-having the bridegroom alongside of{sameselves} they-are_not_being-enabled to-be-fasting.
\v 20 Moreover, days will-be-come when-supposing the bridegroom may-be-lifted-from from of{same}, and then they-will-fast, in to{the-there-s, the days},
\v 21 and not-one is-sewing-upon [an] upon-cast-effect of{not-fulled cloth-piece} upon to{old outer-garment} moreover if not the full-effect of{same} is-lifting the new of{the old} and [a] worse split-effect is-being-become,
\v 22 and not-one is-casting fresh wine into old leathern-bags moreover if not the wine, the fresh, is-tearing the leathern-bags and the wine is-being-poured-out, and the leathern-bags will-perish-off/away; contrariwise, fresh wine into new, cast-able leathern-bags,"
\v 23 and it-becomes to-be-being-gone-aside same in to{the sabbaths} through of{the sown}, and the disciples of{same} initiate to-be-making [a] way, plucking the heads-of-grain,
\v 24 and the Pharisees have-been-saying to{same}, "Behold, what[?] they-are-doing in to{the sabbaths}, which is_not_being-permitted,"
\v 25 and same[singular] has-been-saying to{same}, "Not-yet-ever you-know-anew what[?] David does when he-has need and same hungers, and the alongside of{same},
\v 26 how he-comes-into into the house of{the God} upon of{Abiathar, the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]} and eats the breads of{the place-forth-sis[i.e. state of placing forth]}, which is_not_being-permitted to-eat if not to{the consecrateds[i.e. priests]}, and he-gives also to{the[plural] being} together-with to{same}[?],"
\v 27 and he-has-been-saying to{same}, "The sabbath becomes through the man, not the man through the sabbath,
\v 28 such-as [the] lord is-being the son of{the man} and of{the sabbath},"
\c 3
\v 1 and again he-comes-into into the gathering[translit. "synagogue"], and [a] man has-been-being there having the hand having-been-withered,
\v 2 and they-have-been-keeping-beside same if to{the sabbaths} he-will-heal same, in-which-place they-may-accuse of{same},
\v 3 and he-is-saying to{the man, the having} the hand having-been-withered, "Rouse-self into the midst,"
\v 4 and he-is-saying to{same[plural]}, "It-is-being-permitted to{the sabbaths} to-do-beneficial or to-do-bad, to-save life or to-destroy-off/away[?]" Moreover, the[plural] have-been-being-silent,
\v 5 and view[ing]-around-such-as-to-be-viewed-around same alongside of{wrath}, together-being-grieved upon to{the callousness} of{the heart} of{same[plural]}, he-is-saying to{the man}, "Stretch-out the hand of{you}," and he-stretches-out, and the hand of{same} is-reinstated healthy as the other,
\v 6 and, come[ing]-out, the Pharisees straightaway have-been-making together-intention alongside of{the Herodians} against of{same}, which-how they-may-destroy-off/away same,
\v 7 and the Jesus separates-anew alongside of{the disciples} of{same} toward the seawater, and [a] vast multitude from of{the Galilee} accompany to{same}, and from of{the Judea},
\v 8 and from of{Jerusalems}, and from of{the Idumea} and other-side of{the Jordan} and the[plural] around Tyre and Sidon, [a] vast multitude hear[ing] as-much-as he-has-been-doing, come toward same,
\v 9 and he-says to{the disciples} of{same} in-which-place [a] small-boat may-be-enduring-toward to{same} through the crowd, in-which-place they-should_not_be-pressing/constricting same,
\v 10 for he-heals many such-as to-be-falling-upon to{same[singular]}, in-which-place they-may-take-hold of{same}, as-many-as have-been-having scourges,
\v 11 and the spirits, the unclean, when-supposing has-been-observing same, has-been-falling-toward to{same} and has-been-crying-out, saying that "you are-being the Son of{the God},"
\v 12 and he-has-been-adjudging-value-upon many to{same} in-which-place they-should_not_make same[singular] revealed[adjective],
\v 13 and he-is-ascending into the mountain and is-calling-toward-self whom same[singular] has-been-will-ing, and they-come-off/away toward same,
\v 14 and he-makes twelve, in-which-place they-may-be-being alongside of{same}, and in-which-place he-may-be-sending-off/away same to-be-proclaiming,
\v 15 and to-be-having authority to-be-healing the diseases and to-be-casting-out the demons,
\v 16 and he-places-upon to{the Simon} name 'Peter,'
\v 17 and James the of{the Zebedee}, and John, the brother of{the James}, and he-places-upon to{same} names 'Boanerges,' which is-being 'sons of{thunder},'
\v 18 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James, the of{the Alphaeus}, and Thaddeus, and Simon, the Cananite[/Zealot],
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also gives-aside/delivers same, and they-are-being-come into [a] house,
\v 20 and [a] crowd is-being-come-together again, such-as not to-be-being-enabled same[plural] not-moreover to-eat bread,
\v 21 and, hear[ing], the[plural] beside of{same} come-out to-seize same, for they-have-been-saying that he-astounds,

\v 23 and, call[ing]-toward-self same in to{parables}, he-has-been-saying to{same}, "How is-being-enabled Satan/adversary to-be-casting-out Satan/adversary,[?]
\v 24 and if-supposing [a] kingdom may-be-divided upon sameself, the kingdom, the-there, is_not_being-enabled to-be-stood,
\v 25 and if-supposing [a] home may-be-divided upon sameself, the home, the-there, is_not_being-enabled to-be-stood,
\v 26 and if the Satan/adversary stands-up/anew upon sameself and has-been-divided, he-is_not_being-enabled to-be-stood; contrariwise, he-is-having finish.
\v 27 Not-one is-being-enabled, come[ing]-into into the home of{the strong}, to-snatch-through the vessels of{same}, if-supposing not first he-would-bind the strong, and then he-will-snatch-through the home of{same}.
\v 28 Amen I-am-saying to{you} that all the sin-effects will-be-let-off/away to{the sons} of{the men}, and evil-assertion-ias, as-much-as supposing they-may-assert-evil.
\v 29 Moreover, who supposing may-assert-evil into the Spirit, the Holy, he-is_not_having let-off/away-sis[i.e. state of release] into the eon; contrariwise, he-is-being liable of{eternal judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]}."
\v 30 They-have-been-saying that he-is-having [an] unclean spirit,
\v 31 and the brothers and the mother of{same} are-being-come and, having-stood outside, they-send-off/away toward same, sounding[i.e. beckoning] same,
\v 32 and [a] crowd has-been-being-seated around same. Moreover, they-say to{same}, "Behold, the mother of{you} and the brothers of{you} are-seeking you outside,"
\v 33 and he-responds to{same}, saying, "Who[?] is-being the mother of{me} and the brothers of{me}[?],"
\v 34 and, view[ing]-around-such-as-to-be-viewed-around to{circle} the[plural] around same being-seated, he-is-saying, "Behold, the mother of{me} and the brothers of{me},
\v 35 for who supposing would-do the will-effect of{the God}, the-same is-being brother of{me} and sister and mother,"
\c 4
\v 1 and again he-initiates to-be-teaching beside the seawater, and [a] vast crowd is-being-gathered toward same, such-as same step[ing]-in into the boat to-be-being-seated in to{the seawater}, and all the crowd has-been-being toward the seawater upon of{the land},
\v 2 and he-has-been-teaching same many in to{parables}, and has-been-saying to{same} in to{the teaching} of{same},
\v 3 "Be-hearing, behold, the sowing comes-out of{the} to-sow,
\v 4 and it-becomes in to{the} to-be-sowing, on-one-hand which falls beside the way, and comes the flying-creatures and eats-down same.
\v 5 On-the-other-hand, other falls upon the rocky-behold, which-where it-has_not_been-having much land, and straightaway it-springs-up-out, through the not to-be-having depth of{land}.
\v 6 Moreover, the sun completes-up, it-is-scorched, and through the not to-be-having root, is-withered,
\v 7 and other falls into the thorn-bushes, and the thorn-bushes ascend and together-choke same, and it-does_not_give fruit,
\v 8 and other falls into the land, the good, and it-has-been-giving fruit, ascending and growing, and has-been-carrying, one, thirty, and one, sixty, and one, hundred,"
\v 9 and he-has-been-saying, "The having ears to-be-hearing: be-hearing."
\v 10 Moreover, when he-becomes with-only/alone the around same, together-with to{the} twelve, ask same the parable,
\v 11 and he-has-been-saying to{same}, "To{you} has-been-given to-know the mystery of{the kingdom} of{the God}; moreover, to{the-there-s, the} outside, in to{parables} the all is-being-become,
\v 12 in-which-place 'viewing, they-may-be-viewing and they-would_not_behold and, hearing, they-may-be-hearing and would_not_be-putting-together, not-whereby they-may-turn-upon and the sin-effects would-be-let-off/away-from to{same},'"
\v 13 and he-is-saying to{same}, "You-have_not_beheld the parable, the-same[?], and how[?] you-will-know all the parables[?]
\v 14 The sowing is-sowing the word.
\v 15 Moreover, the-same are-being the beside the way, which-where is-being-sown the word, and when-supposing they-may-hear, straightaway the Satan/adversary is-being-come, and is-lifting the word, the having-been-sown in to{the hearts} of{same},
\v 16 and the-same are-being similarly the being-sown upon the rocky-beholds, who when-supposing may-hear the word, straightaway alongside of{joy} are-taking same,
\v 17 and they-are_not_having root in to{sameselves}; contrariwise, toward-seasons thereafter are-being of{become} of{pressure/constriction/oppression} or of{chasing[noun]} through the word; straightaway they-are-being-scandalized,
\v 18 and the-same[plural] are-being the into the thorn-bushes being-sown, the-same[plural] are-being the hearing the word,
\v 19 and the worries of{the eon, the-same} and the deceit of{the riches} and the desire-upon-ias being-gone-into about the remaining are-together-choking the word, and it-is-being-become unfruitful,
\v 20 and the-same[plural] are-being the upon the land, the good sown, the-who are-hearing the word, and are-receiving-beside/accepting and are-carrying-fruit, one, thirty, and one, sixty, and one, hundred,"
\v 21 and he-has-been-saying to{same}, "Not-what[?] the lamp is-being-come in-which-place it-may-be-placed under the basket-measure or under the couch/bed, not in-which-place it-may-be-placed-upon upon the lampstand[?],

\v 23 If any is-having ears to-be-hearing, [him:] be-hearing,"
\v 24 and he-has-been-saying to{same}, "Be-viewing what you-are-hearing. In to{which measure} you-are-measuring it-will-be-measured to{you}, and it-will-be-placed-toward to{you, the hearing},
\v 25 for who supposing may-be-having, it-will-be-given to{same}, and who is_not_having, also what he-is-having will-be-lifted from of{same},"
\v 26 and he-has-been-saying, "The-same-ly is-being the kingdom of{the God}, as if-supposing [a] man may-cast the seed upon of{the land},
\v 27 and he-may-be-lying-asleep and may-be-being-roused night and day, and the seed may-be-sprouting and may-be-being-lengthened as he-has_not_beheld same,
\v 28 for the automatic land is-fruit-carrying, first pasture/grass, thereafter head-of-grain, thereafter full grain in to{the head-of-grain}.
\v 29 Moreover, when-supposing the fruit may-give-aside/deliver, straightaway he-is-sending-off/away the sickle, that the harvest has-been-stood-beside,"
\v 30 and he-has-been-saying, "To{whom}[?] we-may-liken the kingdom of{the God}, or in to{about-what-such[?] parable} we-may-parable same[?]
\v 31 As [a] kernel of{mustard}, which, when-supposing may-be-sown upon of{the land}, is-being smaller of{all the sow-effects} of{the} upon of{the land},
\v 32 and when-supposing it-may-be-sown, is-ascending and is-being-become larger of{all the herbs}, and is-making large branches, such-as to-be-being-enabled under the shade of{same} the flying-creatures of{the heaven} to-be-roosting,"
\v 33 and to{many to-which-the-same parables} he-has-been-speaking to{same} the word, according-as they-have-been-being-enabled to-be-hearing.
\v 34 Moreover, apart of{parable} he-has_not_been-speaking to{same}. Moreover, with self [i.e. in private] he-has-been-loosing-upon all to{the disciples} of{same},
\v 35 and he-is-saying to{same} in to{the-there, the day,} of{late/evening become}, "We-should-come-through into the other-side,"
\v 36 and, let[ing]-off/away-from the crowd, they-are-taking-aside same, as he-has-been-being in to{the boat} and, moreover, other small-boats; he-has-been-being alongside of{same},
\v 37 and [a] large storm of{wind} is-being-become; moreover, it-has-been-casting-upon the waves into the boat such-as same already to-be-being-fill-ized,

\v 11 Moreover, you are-saying if-supposing [a] man may-say to{the father} or to{the mother}, 'Corban, which is-being gift which if-supposing out of{emphatically-me} you-would-be-profited,'
\v 12 also you-are_not-still_letting-off/away same to-do nothing to{the father} of{same} or to{the mother} of{same},

\v 14 and, call[ing]-toward-self all the crowd, he-has-been-saying to{same}, "Be-hearing of{me}, all, and be-putting-together.
\v 15 Nothing outwardly of{the man} is-being being-gone-into into same which is-being-enabled to-common[i.e. make vulgar/unclean] same; contrariwise, the being-gone-out from of{same}, the-there-s is-being the common-ing[i.e. making vulgar/unclean] the man.
\v 16 If any is-having ears to-be-hearing, [he:] be-hearing,"
\v 17 and when he-comes-into into [the] house from of{the crowd}, the disciples of{same} have-been-asking-upon same about of{the parable},

\v 27 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "Let-off/away-from first the offsprings to-be-fed-ized, for it-is_not_being good to-take the bread of{the offsprings} and to-cast to{the doggies}."
\v 28 Moreover, the responds and is-saying to{same}, "Yes, Lord, for also the doggies down-under of{the table} are-eating from of{the crumblets} of{the childlings},"

\v 1 In to{the-there-s, the days}, again, of{being [a] vast crowd}, and not of{having} what they-may-eat, the Jesus, call[ing]-toward-self the disciples of{same}, is-saying to{same},
\v 2 "I-am-being-affected-inwardly[i.e. feeling compassion] upon the crowd, that already they-are-staying-toward to{me} three days and they-are_not_having what they-may-eat,
\v 3 and if-supposing I-may-loose-off/away same fasting[adjective] into house of{same}, they-will-be-slackened-out in to{the way}, for some of{same} have-arrived afar,"
\v 4 and the disciples of{same} respond to{same}, "Whence[?] any will-enable-self, the-same, here, to-feed-ize of{breads} upon of{desolate-ia}[?],"
\v 5 and he-has-been-asking-upon same, you-are-having how-many[?] breads[?] Moreover, the[plural] say, "Seven,"
\v 6 and he-messages-aside to{the crowd} to-fall-anew[i.e. sit down] upon of{the land} and, take[ing] the seven breads, well-favor[ing]/give[ing]-thanks, he-breaks, and he-has-been-giving to{the disciples} of{same} in-which-place they-may-place-aside, and they-place-aside to{the crowd},
\v 7 and they-have-been-having [a] few fishies and, good-word[ing] same, he-says to-place-aside same also.
\v 8 Moreover, they-eat and are-fed-ized, and they-lift excess-effects of{break-effects/fragments}, seven [large]baskets.
\v 9 Moreover, the eat[ing] have-been-being as four-thousand, and he-looses-off/away same,
\v 10 and straightaway, step[ing]-in into the boat alongside of{the disciples} of{same} he-comes into the Dalmanutha parts,
\v 11 and the Pharisees come-out, and they-initiate to-be-seeking-together to{same}, seeking beside of{same} [a] sign from of{the heaven}, trial-izing same,

\v 13 and let[ing]-off/away same, step[ing]-in again into [the/a] boat, he-comes-off/away into the other-side,
\v 14 and they-forget to-take breads, and if not one bread they-have_not_been-having alongside of{sameselves} in to{the boat},
\v 15 and he-has-been-sending-through-such-as-to-be-being-sent-through to{same}, saying, "Be-seeing; be-viewing from of{the leaven} of{the Pharisees} and of{the leaven} of{Herod},"
\v 16 and they-have-been-being-dialog-ized toward one-another, saying, that "we-are_not_having breads,"
\v 17 and the Jesus, know[ing], is-saying to{same}, "What[?] you-are-being-dialog-ized that you-are_not_having breads[?] Not-yet you-are-thinking, nor-moreover you-are-putting-together; still you-are-having the heart of{you} having-been-callused.
\v 18 Having eyes, you-are_not_viewing, and having ears, you-are_not_hearing, and you-are_not_remembering
\v 19 when I-break the five breads into the five-thousand. How-many[?] baskets full of{break-effects/fragments} you-lift[?]" They-are-saying to{same}, "Twelve."
\v 20 "Moreover, when the seven into the four-thousand, of{how-many}[?] of{[large]baskets} full-effects of{break-effects/fragments} you-lift[?]" Moreover, the[plural] say, "Seven,"
\v 21 and he-has-been-saying to{same}, "How[?] you-are_not_putting-together[?],"
\v 22 and he-is-being-come into Bethsaida and they-are-carrying blind to{same}, and they-are-calling-aside same in-which-place he-may-take-hold of{same},

\v 25 Thereafter, again he-upon-places the hands upon the eyes of{same} and he-makes same to-view-up/anew, and it-is-reinstated, and he-views-in complete-radiantly/clearly emphatically-all,
\v 26 and he-sends-off/away same into the house of{same}, saying, "Neither you-should-come-into into the village, nor you-should-say to{anyone} in to{the village},"
\v 27 and the Jesus comes-out, and the disciples of{same}, into the villages of{Caesarea, the} of{Philip[pi]}, and in to{the way} he-has-been-asking-upon the disciples of{same}, saying to{same}, "Who[?] the men are-saying me to-be-being[?]"
\v 28 Moreover, the[plural] respond, "John the immerser, and others Elijah, moreover others one of{the prophets},"
\v 29 and same[singular] is-saying to{same[plural]}, "Moreover you, who[?] you-are-saying me to-be-being[?]" Moreover, respond[ing] the Peter is-saying to{same}, "You are-being the Anointed,"

\v 33 Moreover, the, upon-turned and behold[ing] the disciples of{same}, adjudges-valuation-upon to{the Peter}, saying, "Be-withdrawing behind of{me}, Satan/adversary, that you-are_not_considering/deeming the of{the God}; contrariwise, the of{the men},"
\v 34 and call[ing]-toward-self the crowd together-with to{the disciples} of{same}, he-says to{same}, "If any is-will-ing to-accompany behind of{me}: deny-off/away sameself and lift the cross of{same} and be-accompanying to{me},

\v 2 and alongside six days the Jesus is-taking-along the Peter and the James and the John and is-bringing-up same into [a] high mountain with self [i.e. in private] alone, and he-is-transformed in-front of{same},
\v 3 and the outer-garments of{same} become glistening[verb participle] white/bright, very as snow, the-which [a] fuller upon of{the land} is_not_being-enabled to-whiten/brighten,
\v 4 and is-seen to{same} Elijah together-with to{Moses}, and they-have-been-being talking-together to{the Jesus},
\v 5 and, respond[ing], the Peter is-saying to{the Jesus}, "Rabbi, it-is-being good, us, to-be-being here, and we-should-make three tents, one to{you} and one to{Moses} and one to{Elijah},"
\v 6 for he-had_not_beheld what he-should-respond, for they-have-been-being out-fearful,
\v 7 and [a] cloud becomes, shadowing-upon to{same}, and [a] sound comes out of{the cloud}, "The-same is-being the son of{me}, the beloved. Be-hearing of{same},"
\v 8 and, out-suddenly/unexpectedly, view[ing]-around-such-as-to-be-viewed-around, not-still not-one they-behold; contrariwise, the Jesus only alongside of{sameselves}.
\v 9 Moreover, of{same descending} from of{the mountain}, he-sends-through-such-as-to-be-sent-through to{same} in-which-place to{no-one} they-may-describe what they-behold, if not when-supposing the son of{the man} would-stand-up/anew out of{dead},

\v 11 and they-have-been-asking-upon same, saying that the scribes are-saying that it-is-necessitating Elijah to-come first.
\v 12 Moreover, the respond[ing] says to{same}, "Elijah on-one-hand, come[ing] first, is-reinstating all, and how it-has-been-written upon the son of{the man} in-which-place many he-may-suffer and may-be-out-not-one-ed/nothing-ed[i.e. disparaged].
\v 13 Contrariwise, I-am-saying to{you} also that Elijah has-come and they-do to{same} as-much-as they-will, according-as it-has-been-written upon same,"
\v 14 and, come[ing] toward the disciples, he-beholds [a] vast crowd around same and scribes, together-seeking to{same},
\v 15 and straightaway all the crowd behold[ing] same is-out-amazed and, hurrying-toward, they-have-been-greeting-to-be-greeted same,
\v 16 and he-asks-upon the scribes, "What[?] you-are-seeking-together toward same[?],"

\v 19 Moreover, the respond[ing] to{same} is-saying, "Oh generation, unbelieving[adjective], until at-what-time[?] I-will-be toward you[?] Until at-what-time[?] I-will-hold/be-held-up/anew of{you}[?] Be-carrying same toward me,"

\v 22 and often same also it-casts into fire and into waters in-which-place it-may-destroy-off/away same; contrariwise, if you-are-being-empowered any, help to{us}, affected-inwardly[i.e. feel[ing] compassion] upon us.
\v 23 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "The 'if.' You-are-being-enabled/empowered to-believe all enabled/empowered[adjective] to{the believing},"
\v 24 and straightaway cry[ing]-out, the father of{the childling}, alongside of{tears}, has-been-saying, "I-am-believing, Lord, be-helping of{me} to{the unbelief}."
\v 25 Moreover, the Jesus behold[ing] that [a] crowd is-rushing-together-upon, he-adjudges-valuation-upon to{the spirit, the unclean}, saying to{same}, "The spirit, the un-speech and deaf/mute, I am-setting-upon to{you}, come-out out of{same} and no-still you-may-come-into into same,"
\v 26 and, cry[ing]-out and much convulse[ing] same, it-comes-out, and he-becomes as-if dead, such-as many to-be-saying that he-dies-off/away.
\v 27 Moreover, the Jesus, seize[ing] same of{the hand}, rouses same, and he-stands-up/anew,
\v 28 and the disciples of{same}, same come[ing]-into into [a] house, have-been-asking-upon same with self [i.e. in private] that "we are_not_enabled to-cast-out same,"

\v 32 Moreover, the[plural] have-been-without-knowing the say-effect/statement, and they-have-been-fearing to-ask-upon same,

\v 36 and, take[ing] [a] childling, he-stands same in to{midst} of{same} and, in-arm-ize[ing]/embrace[ing] same, says to{same[plural]},
\v 37 "Who if-supposing may-receive one of{the to-which-the-same childlings} upon to{the name} of{me} is-receiving emphatically-me, and who if-supposing may-receive emphatically-me is-receiving not emphatically-me; contrariwise, the send[ing]-off/away me."
\v 38 Moreover, the John responds to{same}, saying, "Teacher, we-behold someone in to{the name} of{you} casting-out demons, who is_not_accompanying to{us} and we-hinder same, that he-is_not_accompanying to{us}."
\v 39 Moreover, the Jesus says, "Do_not_be-hindering same, for not-one is-being who will-do [an] enablement upon to{the name} of{me} and will-enable-self speedily to-say-bad[of/to] me,
\v 40 for who is_not_being down/against of{us} is-being over/for-the-sake of{us},

\v 1 and-thence, stand[ing]-up/anew, he-is-being-come into the boundaries of{the Judea} through of{the} other-side of{the Jordan}, and crowds are-being-gone-together again toward same and, as he-had-been-accustomed, he-has-been-teaching same again,
\v 2 and Pharisees, come[ing]-toward, ask-upon same if it-is-being-permitted to{man} to-loose-off/away [a] woman, trial-izing same.
\v 3 Moreover, the respond[ing] says to{same}, "What[?] Moses commands to{you}[?]"
\v 4 Moreover, the say, "Moses upon-turns to-write scrollet of{off/away-standing} and to-loose-off/away,"
\v 5 and, respond[ing], the Jesus says to{same}, "Toward the hard-heart of{you} he-writes to{you} the command, the-same.
\v 6 Moreover, from of{origin creation} the God makes same male and female.
\v 7 Because of{the-same} [a] man will-leave-behind the father of{same} and the mother, and will-be-glued/welded/adhered/conjoined-toward toward the woman of{same},
\v 8 and the two will-be into one flesh, such-as not-still they-are-being two; contrariwise, one flesh.
\v 9 So, what the God yokes-together, man: be_no_separating,"
\v 10 and in to{the home} again the disciples of{same} ask-upon same about of{the same},
\v 11 and he-is-saying to{same}, "Who if-supposing may-loose-off/away the woman of{same} and may-marry another is-adultering/being-adultered upon same[feminine],
\v 12 and if-supposing [a] woman may-loose-off/away the man of{same} and may-be-married to{another} is-adultering/being-adultered,"
\v 13 and they-have-been-carrying-toward to{same} childlings in-which-place he-may-take-hold of{same}; moreover, the disciples have-been-adjudging-valuation-upon to{the carrying-toward}.
\v 14 Moreover, the Jesus, behold[ing], is-irritated, and says to{same}, "Let-off/away-from the childlings to-be-coming toward me. Do_not_be-hindering same, for of{the to-which-the-same} is-being the kingdom of{the God}.
\v 15 Amen I-am-saying to{you}, who if-supposing should_not_receive the kingdom of{the God} as [a] childling, no, he-would_not_come-into into same,"
\v 16 and, in-arm-ize[ing]/embrace[ing] same, placing the hands upon same, he-has-been-good-word-ing same,
\v 17 and of{same[singular] being-gone-out} into [the] way, one hurry[ing]-toward and knee-fall[ing] same has-been-asking-upon same, "Beneficial teacher, what[?] I-may-do in-which-place I-may-inherit eternal being-alive[noun][?]"
\v 18 Moreover the Jesus says to{same}, "What[?] you-are-saying me beneficial[?] Not-one beneficial if not one, the God.
\v 19 You-have-beheld the commands, you-should_not_adulter, you-should_not_murder, you-should_not_steal, you-should_not_false-witness, you-should_not_deprive-off/away-from, be-valuing the father of{you} and the mother."
\v 20 Moreover, the respond[ing] says to{same}, "Teacher, the-same all I-guard-such-as-to-be-guarded out of{youth} of{me}."
\v 21 Moreover, the Jesus, view[ing]-in to{same}, loves same, and says to{same}, "One to{you} is-being-deficient/lacking. Be-withdrawing. As-much-as you-are-having, sell and give to{destitute} and you-will-have wealth in to{heaven} and, Come! be-accompanying to{me}, lift[ing] the cross."
\v 22 Moreover the, be[ing]-gloomy upon to{the word}, comes-off/away being-grieved, for he-has-been-being having many acquire-effects,
\v 23 and, view[ing]-around-such-as-to-be-viewed-around, the Jesus is-saying to{the disciples} of{same}, "How difficultly the having the business-effects will-come-into into the kingdom of{the God}."
\v 24 Moreover, the disciples have-been-being-amazed upon to{the words} of{same}. Moreover, the Jesus, respond[ing] again, is-saying to{same}, "Offsprings, how difficult it-is-being, the having-had-confidence upon to{the business-effects}, to-come-into into the kingdom of{the God}.
\v 25 It-is-being easier, camel to-come-through through of{the hole} of{the needle} than rich into the kingdom of{the God} to-come-into."
\v 26 Moreover, the[plural] have-been-being-impacted exceedingly, saying toward sameselves, "And who[?] is-being-enabled to-be-saved[?]"
\v 27 Moreover, view[ing]-in to{same}, the Jesus is-saying, "Beside to{men} unenabled[adjective]; contrariwise, not beside to{the God}, for all is-being enabled beside to{the God}."
\v 28 The Peter initiates to-be-saying to{same}, "Behold, we let-off/away all and accompany to{you}."
\v 29 Respond[ing], the Jesus says, "Amen I-am-saying to{you} not-one is-being who lets-off/away home or brothers or sisters or father or mother or woman or offsprings or fields because of{emphatically-me} and because of{the good-message}
\v 30 if-supposing should_not_take [a] hundredfold now in to{the season, the-same,} homes and brothers and sisters and mothers and offsprings and fields, alongside of{chasings[noun]}, and in to{the eon, the being-come}, eternal being-alive[noun].
\v 31 Moreover, many firsts will-be lasts and lasts firsts."
\v 32 Moreover, they-have-been-being in to{the way}, ascending into Jerusalem, and the Jesus has-been-being leading-before same, and they-have-been-being-amazed, and, accompanying, they-have-been-fearing and, take[ing]-aside the twelve again, he-initiates to-be-telling to{same[plural]} the about-to-be-being to{same[singular]} to-be-stepping-together[i.e. events to be unfolding together],
\v 33 that, "Behold, we-are-ascending into Jerusalem and the son of{the man} will-be-given-aside/delivered to{the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests]} and to{the scribes} and they-will-judge-against same to{death} and they-will-give-aside/deliver same to{the nations},

\v 36 Moreover, the says to{same}, "What[?] you-are-will-ing me to-do to{you}[?]"
\v 37 Moreover, the say to{same}, "Give to{us} in-which-place we-may-sit-down, one out of{right} of{you} and one out of{left} of{you}, in to{the esteem/glory} of{you}."
\v 38 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "You-have_not_beheld what you-are-giving-cause/requesting-for-selves. You-are-being-enabled to-drink the cup which I am-drinking and the immerse-effect which I am-being-immersed to-be-immersed[?]"
\v 39 Moreover, the say to{same}, "We-are-being-enabled." Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "On-one-hand the cup which I am-drinking you-will-drink and the immerse-effect which I am-being-immersed you-will-be-immersed.
\v 40 On-the-other-hand, the to-sit-down out of{right} of{me} and out of{left} of{me} is_not_being mine to-give; contrariwise, to{whom} it-has-been-prepared,"

\v 48 and many have-been-adjudging-valuation-upon to{same} in-which-place he-should-be-silent; moreover, the to{much} more he-has-been-crying-out, "Son [of-]David, show-mercy-to me,"
\v 49 and, stand[ing], the Jesus says to-be-sounded same, and they-are-sounding the blind, saying to{same}, "Be-having-courage; rouse-self; he-is-sounding you."
\v 50 Moreover, the, cast[ing]-off/away the outer-garment of{same}, stand[ing]-up/anew, he-comes toward the Jesus,
\v 51 and, respond[ing], the Jesus is-saying to{same}, "What[?] you-are-will-ing I-may-do to{you}[?]" Moreover, the blind says to{same}, "Rabboni, in-which-place I-may-view-up/anew."
\v 52 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "Be-withdrawing. The faith of{you} has-saved you," and straightaway he-views-up/anew, and he-has-been-accompanying to{same} in to{the way},
\c 11
\v 1 and when they-are-becoming-near into Jerusalem into Bethphage and Bethany toward the mountain of{the olives} he-is-sending-off/away two of{the disciples} of{same},
\v 2 and he-is-saying to{same}, "Be-withdrawing into the village, the down-in-in-place-of[/opposite/in-front-of] of{you} and straightaway, being-gone-into into same you-will-discover [a] colt having-been-bound upon which not-one of{men} has-been-seated. Loose[ing] same, lead,

\v 4 Moreover, they-come-off/away and discover [a] colt having-been-bound toward the entrance out upon of{the encircle-way}, and they-are-loosing same,
\v 5 and some of{the having-stood} there have-been-saying to{same}, "What[?] you-are-doing, loosing the colt[?]"
\v 6 Moreover, the[plural] say to{same} according-as the Jesus commands and they-let-off/away same,
\v 7 and they-lead the colt toward the Jesus, and they-cast-upon to{same} the outer-garments of{same}, and he-sits-down upon to{same}.
\v 8 Moreover, many spread the outer-garments of{same} into the way; moreover, others have-been-cutting stuffing/bedding out of{the trees} and have-been-spreading into the way,
\v 9 and the leading-before and the accompanying have-been-crying-out, saying, "Hosanna, having-been-good-word-ed, the being-come in to{[the] name} of{[the] Lord}.
\v 10 Having-been-good-word-ed, the being-come kingdom in to{[the] name} of{[the] Lord} of{the father} of{us}, David, hosanna in to{the highest},"
\v 11 and the Jesus comes-into into Jerusalem and into the consecrated[i.e. temple] and, view[ing]-around-such-as-to-be-viewed-around all, of{the hour being late/evening} already, he-comes-out into Bethany alongside of{the} twelve,
\v 12 and to{the} upon-the-next-day, of{same[plural] come[ing]-out} from of{Bethany}, he-hungers,
\v 13 and, behold[ing] [a] fig-tree afar having leaves, he-comes, if of-consequence he-will-discover any in to{same} and, come[ing] upon same, he-discovers not-one, if not leaves, for it-has_not_been-being [the] season of{figs},
\v 14 and, respond[ing], the Jesus says to{same}, "No-one might-eat fruit no-still out of{you} into the eon," and the disciples of{same} have-been-hearing,
\v 15 and they-are-being-come into Jerusalem, and the Jesus, come[ing]-into into the consecrated[i.e. temple], initiates to-be-casting-out the selling and purchasing in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, and he-overturns the tables of{the money-changers} and the seats of{the selling} the pigeons/doves,
\v 16 and he-has_not_been-letting-off in-which-place any may-carry-through [a] vessel through of{the consecrated[i.e. temple]},

\v 19 and when it-becomes late, he-has-been-being-gone-out out of{the city},
\v 20 and early/morning being-gone-by, they-behold the fig-tree having-been-withered out of{roots},
\v 21 and the Peter, reminded-anew, is-saying to{same}, "Rabbi, behold, the fig-tree which you-curse-down/against has-withered,"

\v 29 Moreover, the Jesus, respond[ing], says to{same}, "Also-I will-ask-upon you one word, and respond to{me}, and I-will-say to{you} in to{about-what-such authority} I-am-doing the-same.
\v 30 The immerse-effect of{John} has-been-being out of{heaven} or out of{men}[?] Respond to{me},"

\v 32 contrariwise, if-supposing we-may-say, 'Out of{men}--,'" they-have-been-fearing the people, for emphatically-all have-been-having the John that being-ly/actually he-has-been-being [a] prophet,

\c 12
\v 1 and he-initiates to-be-saying to{same} in to{parables}. "[A] man plants [a] vineyard and places-around [a] barrier and digs [a] [wine]vat and house-builds [a] tower and gives-out same to{land-workers} and goes-abroad,
\v 2 and he-sends-off/away toward the land-workers to{the season} [a] slave, in-which-place beside of{the land-workers} he-may-take from of{the fruit} of{the vineyard}.

\v 6 So, still having one son, beloved of{same}, he-sends-off/away also same toward same[plural] last, saying that they-will-be-introspected-about the son of{me}.
\v 7 Moreover, the-there-s, the land-workers, say toward sameselves that 'the-same is-being the inheritor. Come!, we-may-be-killing-off/away same and the inheritance will-be of{us},'
\v 8 and, take[ing] same, they-kill-off/away and cast-out out of{the vineyard}.
\v 9 So, what[?] the lord of{the vineyard} will-do[?] He-will-be-come and will-destroy-off/away the land-workers, and will-give the vineyard to{others}.

\v 13 and they-are-sending-off/away toward same some of{the Pharisees} and of{the Herodians} in-which-place they-may-catch same to{word}.
\v 14 Moreover, the, come[ing], are-saying to{same}, "Teacher, we-have-beheld that you-are-being true, and it-is_not_concerning to{you} about of{not-one}, for you-are_not_viewing into [the] face of{men}; contrariwise, upon of{truth} you-are-teaching the way of{the God}.

\v 17 and, respond[ing], the Jesus says to{same}, "Give-off/away the of{Caesar} to{Caesar} and the of{the God} to{the God}," and they-marvel upon to{same},
\v 18 and Sadducees are-being-come toward same, the-who are-saying to_no_be-being stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection], and they-ask-upon same, saying,
\v 19 "Teacher, Moses writes to{us} that if-supposing [a] brother of{any} may-die-off/away and may-leave-behind [a] woman and may_not_let-off/away offsprings, in-which-place the brother of{same} should-take the woman of{same} and should-stand-up/anew-out[i.e. procreate] sow-effect to{the brother} of{same}.

\v 27 The God is_not_being of{dead}; contrariwise, of{being-alive}. So, you-are-being-led-astray much,"
\v 28 and one of{the scribes}, come[ing]-toward, hear[ing] of{same[plural] seeking-together}, having-beheld that he-responds well to{same[plural]}, asks-upon same about-what-such[?] is-being [the] first command of{all}.
\v 29 Moreover, the Jesus responds to{same} that "first of{all the commands}, 'Be-hearing, Israel, [the] Lord the God of{us} is-being one Lord,
