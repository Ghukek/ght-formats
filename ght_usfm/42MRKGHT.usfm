\v 16 the John responds to{emphatically-all}, saying, "I, on-one-hand, am-immersing you to{water}; on-the-other-hand, the stronger of{me} is-being-come, of{whom} I-am_not_being sufficient to-loose the strap of{the footwear} of{same}. Same will-immerse you in to{Holy Spirit} and to{fire},

\v 18 So, on-one-hand, also calling-aside many different-others, he-has-been-good-message-izing the people;
\v 19 on-the-other-hand, the Herod, the fourth-part-origin-ruler[Latin translit. "tetrarch"], being-confuted under of{same} about of{Herodias, the woman} of{Philip, the brother} of{same}, and about of{all which} the Herod does of{evil},
\v 20 he-places-toward the-same upon to{all} also; he-closes-down/against[i.e. locks up] the John in to{the custody[i.e. prison]}.
\v 21 Moreover, it-becomes in to{the} to-be-immersed, emphatically-all the people, also of{Jesus immersed} and of{praying}, to-be-opened-up/anew the heaven,

\v 13 and together-complete[ing] every trial-ization, the devil/slanderous stands-off/away-from from of{same}, even-to of{season},

\v 4 Moreover, as he-stops speaking, he-says toward the Simon, "Lead-upon into the depth and loosen/lower the nets of{you[plural]} into [a] catch,"
\v 5 and, respond[ing], the Simon says to{same}, "Superintendent, through of{the whole night}, toil[ing], we-take not-one; moreover, upon to{the say-effect/statement} of{you} I-will-loosen/lower the net,"

\v 22 Moreover, the Jesus, know[ing]-upon the dialog-iz-ations of{same}, respond[ing], says toward same, "What[?] you-are-being-dialog-ized in to{the hearts} of{you}[?]
\v 23 What[?] is-being easier to-say[?], 'The sins of{you} have-been-let-off/away to{you},' or to-say, 'Rouse-self and be-walking-around'[?]
\v 24 Moreover, in-which-place you-should-have-beheld that the son of{the man} is-having authority upon of{the earth} to-be-letting-off/away sins," he-says to{the having-been-paralyzed}, "I-am-saying to{you}, rouse-self and, lift[ing] the bedlet/cot of{you}, be-being-gone into the house of{you},"

\v 32 I-have_not_come to-call [the] just; contrariwise, [the] sinful into change-of-mind/thinking."
\v 33 Moreover, the[plural] say toward same, "Through what[?] the disciples of{John} are-fasting often and are-making-selves necessitations, and similarly the of{the Pharisees}; moreover, the to{you} are-eating and are-drinking."
\v 34 Moreover, the Jesus says toward same, "You-are_not_being-enabled, the sons of{the bridal-chamber}, in to{whom} the bridegroom is-being alongside of{same}, to-make to-be-fasting.
\v 35 Moreover, days will-be-come also when-supposing the bridegroom should-be-lifted-off/away-from from of{same}; then they-will-fast in to{the days, the-there-s}."
\v 36 Moreover, he-has-been-saying also [a] parable toward same, that "not-one is-casting-upon [an] upon-cast-effect of{new outer-garment} upon [an] old outer-garment; moreover, if no-indeed also the new will-split also to{the old}; it-is_not_sounding-together/being-in-harmony/accord, the upon-cast-effect, the from of{the new},

\v 32 and if you-are-loving the loving you, about-what-such[?] grace/favor is-being to{you}, for also the sinful are-loving the loving same,
\v 33 and if-supposing you-may-be-doing-beneficial the doing-beneficial you, about-what-such[?] grace/favor is-being to{you}, for also the sinful are-doing the same,
\v 34 and if-supposing you-may-loan-ize beside of{whom} you-are-expect[ize]ing to-take-off/away-from, about-what-such[?] grace/favor is-being to{you}, for also sinful are-loan-izing to{sinful}, in-which-place they-may-take-off/away-from the equal.
\v 35 More-ly, be-loving the hostile of{you} and be-doing-beneficial and be-loan-izing, expect[ize]ing-off/away nothing, and the wage of{you} will-be much and you-will-be sons of{[the] highest}, that same is-being benevolent upon the ungracious/unfavorable and evil.
\v 36 So, be-becoming compassionate according-as also the Father of{you} is-being compassionate,
\v 37 and do_not_be-judging, and no, you-should_not_be-judged. Do_not_be-justifying-down/against/condemn, and no, you-should_not_be-justified-down/against/condemned. Be-loosing-off/away-from, and you-will-be-loosed-off/away-from.
\v 38 Be-giving, and it-will-be-given to{you}, [a] good measure having-been-pressed and having-been-shaken and being-poured-out-over they-will-give into the bosom/lap of{you}, for to{the same measure which} you-are-measuring it-will-be-measured-in-place-of to{you}."
\v 39 Moreover, he-says [a] parable to{same}. "No-what[?] blind is-being-enabled to-be-leading-way blind[?] Emphatically-not; both will-fall-selves into [a] pit.
\v 40 [A] disciple is_not_being over the teacher of{same}; moreover, having-been-fit-ized-down/adjusted/equipped, every will-be as the teacher of{same}.
\v 41 Moreover, what[?] you-are-viewing the twig, the in to{the eye} of{the brother} of{you}; moreover, you-are_not_thinking-according-to/considering the log, the in to{the own eye}[?]
\v 42 Or, how[?] you-are-being-enabled to-be-saying to{the brother} of{you}, 'Brother, let-off/away, I-may-cast-out the twig, the in to{the eye} of{you},' same not viewing the log in to{the eye} of{you}[?] Pretender, first cast-out the log out of{the eye} of{you} and then you-will-view-through to-cast-out the twig, the in to{the eye} of{the brother} of{you},
\v 43 for [a] good tree is_not_being making worthless fruit, nor [a] worthless tree making good fruit,
\v 44 for each tree is-being-known out of{the own fruit}, for they-are-collecting figs not out of{thorn-bushes}, nor are-picking/gathering [a] [ripe]bunch-of-grapes out of{[a] bramble/briar-bush}.
\v 45 The beneficial man is-carrying-forth the beneficial out of{the beneficial wealth} of{the heart} of{same} and the evil man is-carrying-forth the evil out of{the evil wealth} of{the heart} of{same}, for out of{the excess-effect} of{the heart} the mouth of{same} is-speaking.
\v 46 Moreover, what[?] you-are-calling me 'Lord, Lord," and are_not_doing what I-am-saying[?]
\v 47 The every being-come toward me and hearing of{the words} of{me} and doing same, I-will-show-under to{you} to{whom} it-is-being analogous.
\v 48 It-is-being analogous to{[a] man house-building} [a] home who excavates and deepens and places [a] foundation upon the rock-mass. Moreover, of{flood become}, the river tears-toward to{the home, the-there} and it-does_not_have-strength to-shake same, for it-had-been-foundation-ed upon the rock-mass.
\v 49 Moreover, the hear[ing] and no do[ing] is-being analogous to{[a] man house-build[ing]} [a] home upon the land separate of{foundation}, to{which} the river tears-toward, and straightaway together-falls, and great becomes the tear-effect of{the home, the-there}."
\c 7
\v 1 Moreover, since he-fills-full all the say-effects/statements of{same} into the hearings[noun] of{the people}, he-comes-into into Capernaum.
\v 2 Moreover, [a] slave of{some hundred-chief/centurion}, having unwell, has-been-being-about to-be-deceasing, who has-been-being invaluable to{same}.
\v 3 Moreover, hear[ing] about of{the Jesus}, he-sends-off/away, toward same, elders of{the Judeans}, asking same which-how, come[ing], he-may-through-save the slave of{same}.
\v 4 Moreover, the[plural], being[ing]-become-aside toward the Jesus, have-been-calling-aside same expediently, saying that "he-is-being worthwhile to{whom} he-will-have-aside/present the-same,
\v 5 for he-is-loving the nation of{us}, and same house-builds the gathering[translit. 'synagogue'] to{us}."
\v 6 Moreover, the Jesus has-been-being-gone together-with to{same[plural]}. Moreover, already of{same} not far of{having-off/away-from} from of{the home}, the hundred-chief/centurion dispatches toward same friends, saying to{same}, "Lord, do_not_be-being-hassled, for I-am_not_being sufficient in-which-place you-may-come-into under the roof of{me},
\v 7 nor through-which I-consider-worthwhile myself toward you to-come; contrariwise, say to{word} and the child of{me} will-be-cured,
\v 8 for also I am-being [a] man under authority, having setting under myself soldiers, and I-am-saying to{the-same}, 'Be-gone,' and he-is-being-gone, and to{another}, 'Be-being-come,' and he-is-being-come, and to{the slave} of{me}, 'Do the-same,' and he-is-doing."
\v 9 Moreover, hear[ing] the-same, the Jesus marvels same and, turned to{the same crowd accompanying}, says, "I-am-saying to{you} moreover-not in to{the} Israel I-discover the-which-the-same faith,"
\v 10 and the dispatched return[ing] into the house discover the being-infirm slave being-healthy,
\v 11 and it-becomes in to{the} next; he-has-been-being-gone into [a] city being-called Nain, and the disciples of{same} have-been-being-gone-together to{same}, sufficient, and [a] vast crowd.
\v 12 Moreover, as he-becomes-near to{the gate} of{the city}, also, behold, [a] having-died has-been-being-out-attend-ized, [an] only-begotten son to{the mother} of{same} and same[feminine] has-been-being [a] widow, and [a] crowd of{the city}, sufficient, has-been-being together-with to{same[feminine]},
\v 13 and, behold[ing] same[feminine], the Lord is-affected-inwardly[i.e. feels compassion] upon to{same[feminine]} and says to{same[feminine]}, "Do_not_be-weeping,"
\v 14 and, come[ing]-toward, he-takes-hold of{the coffin}; moreover, the[plural] bearing[weight] stand, and he-says, "Youngster, I-am-saying to{you}, be-roused,"
\v 15 and the dead sits-up/anew and initiates to-be-speaking, and he-gives same to{the mother} of{same}.
\v 16 Moreover, fear takes emphatically-all and they-have-been-esteem-izing/glorifying the God, saying that "[a] great prophet has-been-roused in to{us}," and that the God watches-upon the people of{same},
\v 17 and the word, the-same, comes-out in to{the whole Judea} about of{same}, and in to{all the region-around},
\v 18 and the disciples of{same} message-off/away to{John} about of{all the-same},
\v 19 and, call[ing]-toward-self some two of{the disciples} of{same}, the John dispatches toward the Jesus, saying, "You are-being the being-come, or another we-should-be-esteeming-toward/anticipating[?]"
\v 20 Moreover, the men become[ing]-aside toward same say, "John, the immerser, has-sent-off/away us toward you, saying, 'You are-being the being-come, or another we-should-be-esteeming-toward/anticipating[?]'"
\v 21 Moreover, in to{same, the hour} he-heals many from of{diseases} and of{scourges} and of{evil spirits} and to{many blind} he-gratifies the to-be-viewing,
\v 22 and, respond[ing], the Jesus says to{same}, "Be[ing]-gone, message-off/away to{John} what you-behold and hear. Blind are-viewing-anew, lame are-walking-around, leprous are-being-purged/cleansed, deaf/mute are-hearing, dead are-being-roused, and destitute are-being-good-message-ized,
\v 23 and blessed is-being who if-supposing would_not_be-scandalized in to{emphatically-me}."
\v 24 Moreover, of{come[ing]-off/away, the messengers} of{John}, he-initiates to-be-saying toward the crowds about of{John}, "What[?] you-come-out into the desolate to-spectate, [a] reed being-shaken under of{wind}[?]
\v 25 Contrariwise, what[?] you-come-out to-behold, [a] man having-been-dressed in to{soft outer-garments}[?] Behold, the in to{in-esteem-ious/glorious outer-garment-set} and to{luxury} are-being originating-under in to{the king-dwellings/palaces}.
\v 26 Contrariwise, what[?] you-come-out to-behold[?] [A] prophet, yes, I-am-saying to{you}, and more-excessive of{[a] prophet}.
\v 27 The-same is-being about of{whom} it-has-been-written, 'Behold, I am-sending-off/away the messenger of{me} before of{[the] face} of{you}, who will-equip-ize/furnish the way of{you} in-front of{you},'
\v 28 for I-am-saying to{you}, not-one prophet in to{begotten} of{women} is-being greater-than of{John, the immerser}; moreover, the lesser in to{the kingdom} of{the God} is-being greater-than of{same},"
\v 29 and all the people hear[ing], also the [tax]collectors, justify the God, immersed the immerse-effect of{John}.
\v 30 Moreover, the Pharisees and the lawyers un-place/nullify/reject the intent of{the God} into sameselves, no immersed under of{same}.
\v 31 "So, to{what[?]} I-will-liken the men of{the generation, the-same} and to{what[?]} they-are-being analogous[?]
\v 32 They-are-being analogous to{childlings, the} in to{[the] marketplace being-seated} and to{sounding-toward one-another}, and are-saying, 'We-flute to{you} and you-do_not_dance; we-lament to{you} and you-do_not_weep,'
\v 33 for John, the immerser, has-come neither eating bread nor drinking wine and you-are-saying, 'He-is-having demon.'
\v 34 The son of{the man} has-come eating and drinking and you-are-saying, 'Behold, [a] glutton man and wine-bibber, friend of{[tax]collectors} and of{sinful},'
\v 35 and the wisdom is-justified off/away-from of{the offsprings} of{all} of{same}."
\v 36 Moreover, someone of{the Pharisees} has-been-asking same in-which-place he-may-eat alongside of{same} and, come[ing]-into into the house of{the Pharisee} he-is-reclined,
\v 37 and behold, [a] woman in to{the city}, the-who has-been-being sinful, upon-know[ing] that he-is-being-lain-up/anew in to{the home} of{the Pharisee}, attend-ize[ing] [an] alabaster-vessel of{ointment},
\v 38 and stand[ing] beside the feet of{same} behind, weeping, initiates to-be-wetting the feet of{same} to{the tears} and has-been-out-wiping to{the hairs} of{the head} of{same[feminine]}, and has-been-fonding-down/against the feet of{same}, and has-been-oiling to{the ointment}.
\v 39 Moreover, the Pharisee, the call[ing] same, behold[ing], says in to{sameself}, saying, "The-same, if he-has-been-being [a] prophet, has-been-knowing supposing who and when-where/what-manner the woman, the-who is-taking-hold of{same}, that she-is-being sinful,"
\v 40 and, respond[ing], the Jesus says toward same, "Simon, I-am-having something to-say to{you}." Moreover, the is-asserting, "Teacher, say."
\v 41 "Two obligation-owe-ers have-been-being to{some debt}. The one has-been-owing five-hundred denarii; moreover, the different-other fifty.
\v 42 Moreover, no of{having same} to-give-off/away, he-is-favor-ized to{both}. So, who[?] of{same}, say, will-love same much-more[?]"
\v 43 Moreover, respond[ing], the Simon says, "I-am-taking-under that the to{whom} is-favor-ized much-more." Moreover, the says to{same}, "Straight-up-ly you-judge,"
\v 44 and, turned toward the woman, he-has-been-asserting to{the Simon}, "You-are-viewing the-same, the woman. I-come-into into the home of{you}; you-do_not_give water upon the feet of{me}; moreover, same wets the feet of{me} to{the tears} and out-wipes to{the hairs} of{the head} of{same}.
\v 45 You-do_not_give [a] fond-effect to{me}; moreover, same from of{whom} I-come-into does_not_discontinue fonding-down/against the feet of{me}.
\v 46 You-do_not_oil the head of{me} to{olive-oil}; moreover, same oils the feet of{me} to{ointment},
\v 47 of{which} I-am-saying grace/favor to{you}, the sins of{same}, the many, have-been-let-off/away, that she-loves much; moreover to{whom} is-being-let-off/away scant, is-loving scant."
\v 48 Moreover, he-says to{same[feminine]}, "The sins of{you} have-been-let-off/away,"
\v 49 and the being-lain-up/anew-together initiate to-be-saying in to{sameselves}, "Who[?], the-same, is-being, who also is-letting-off/away sins[?]"
\v 50 Moreover, he-says toward the woman, "The faith of{you} has-saved you. Be-being-gone into peace,"
\c 8
\v 1 and it-becomes in to{the} consecutively also same has-been-traveling-through according-to city and village, proclaiming and good-message-izing the kingdom of{the God}, and the twelve together-with to{same},

\v 3 and of{Joanna}, woman of{Chuza}, of{administrator} of{Herod}, and Susanna, and many different-others, the-who have-been-serving to{same[plural]} from of{the[plural] originating-under} to{same[plural]}.
\v 4 Moreover, of{[a] vast crowd together-being} and of{the[plural] being-gone-upon} according-to city he-says toward same through of{parable},
\v 5 "The sowing comes-out of{the} to-sow the seed of{same} and in to{the} to-be-sowing same, the on-one-hand falls beside the way and is-walked-down/against[i.e. trampled], and the flying-creatures of{the heaven} eats-down same,
\v 6 and different-other falls upon the rock-mass and, produce[ing], is-withered through the to-be-having no moisture,
\v 7 and different-other falls in to{midst} of{the thorn-bushes} and, produce[ing]-together, the thorn-bushes suffocate-off/away same,
\v 8 and different-other falls into the land, the beneficial, and, produce[ing], makes [a] hundredfold fruit." Saying the-same, he-has-been-sounding, "The having ears to-be-hearing: be-hearing."
\v 9 Moreover, the disciples of{same} have-been-asking-upon same, saying, "Who[?] might-be-being the parable, the-same[?]"
\v 10 Moreover, the says, "To{you} has-been-given to-know the mysteries of{the kingdom} of{the God}; moreover, to{the remaining}, in to{parables}, in-which-place viewing, they-would_not_be-viewing, and hearing, they-would_not_be-putting-together.
\v 11 Moreover, the-same is-being the parable: The seed is-being the word of{the God}.
\v 12 Moreover, the beside the way are-being the hearing; thereafter, the devil/slanderous is-being-come and is-lifting the word off/away-from of{the heart} of{same}, lest in-which-place, believe[ing]/entrust[ing], they-would-be-saved.
\v 13 Moreover, the upon of{the rock-mass}, the when-supposing may-hear, alongside of{joy} they-are-receiving the word, and the-same are_not_having root. The toward season are-believing/entrusting and in to{season} of{trial-ization} are-being-stood-off/away.
\v 14 Moreover, the fall[ing] into the thorn-bushes, the-same are-being the hear[ing], and being-gone under of{worries} and of{riches} and of{pleasures} of{the livelihood}, are-together-being-choked and are_not_carrying-to-completion.
\v 15 Moreover, the in to{the good land}, the-same are-being the-some hear[ing] the word in to{good heart} and to{beneficial}. They-are-having/holding-according-to and are-carrying-fruit in to{remain-under-ance/perseverance}.
\v 16 Moreover, not-one kindle[ing] [a] lamp is-covering same to{vessel} or is-placing down-under of{couch/bed}; contrariwise, upon of{[a] lampstand} is-placing-upon, in-which-place the being-gone-into may-be-viewing the light,
\v 17 for [the] hidden[adjective] is_not_being which will-become not revealed[adjective], nor [the] hidden-off/away-from[adjective], which will_not_be-known, also may-come into [the] revealed[adjective].
\v 18 So, be-viewing how you-are-hearing, for who supposing may-be-having, it-will-be-given to{same}, and who supposing would_not_be-having, also what he-is-esteeming to-be-having will-be-lifted off/away-from of{same}."
\v 19 Moreover, the mother and the brothers of{same} become-aside toward same, and they-have_not_been-being-enabled to-occur-together to{same} through the crowd,
\v 20 and it-is-messaged-off/away to{same}, of{saying}, "The mother of{you} and the brothers of{you} have-stood outside will-ing to-behold you."
\v 21 Moreover, the respond[ing] says toward same, "[The] mother of{me} and [the] brothers of{me}, the-same are-being the hearing the word of{the God} and doing same,"
\v 22 and it-becomes in to{one} of{the days} also same steps-in into [a] boat, and the disciples of{same}, and he-says toward same, "We-should-come-through into the other-side of{the lake}," and they-are-led-up/anew.
\v 23 Moreover, of{same boating}, he-sleeps-off/away, and [a] storm of{wind} descends into the lake, and they-have-been-being-together-filled-full and they-have-been-being-in-danger.
\v 24 Moreover, come[ing]-toward, they-through-rouse same, saying, "Superintendent, superintendent, we-are-perishing-off/away." Moreover, the roused adjudges-valuation-upon to{the wind} and to{the wave/surge/billow} of{the water} and they-cease and it-becomes calm.
\v 25 Moreover, he-says to{same}, "Where[?] is-being the faith of{you}[?]" Moreover, fear[ing], they-marvel, saying toward one-another, "Who[?] of-consequence is-being the-same, that also to{the winds} he-is-setting-upon, and to{the water}, and they-are-hearkening-under to{same}[?],"
\v 26 and they-boat into the region of{the Gadarenes} which-what is-being opposite-side-ly of{the Galilee}.
\v 27 Moreover, to{same come[ing]-out} upon the land he-encounters to{same} some man out of{the city} who has-been-having demons out of{sufficient times}, and outer-garment has_not_been-being-clothed, and in to{[a] home} has_not_been-staying; contrariwise, in to{the memorial-effects}.
\v 28 Moreover, behold[ing] the Jesus and cry[ing]-out-up/anew, he-falls-toward to{same} and to{great sound} says, "What[?] to{emphatically-me} and to{you}, Jesus, Son of{the God, the highest}[?] I-am-being-necessitated of{you} you-would_not_torture me,"
\v 29 for he-messages-aside to{the spirit, the unclean} to-come-out from of{the man}, for to{many times} it-had-together-snatched same, and he-has-been-being-fettered to{un-loose-sis-es[i.e. states of being restrained]/restraints} and to{[foot]shackles}, being-guarded, and, tearing the bonds, he-has-been-being-propelled under of{the demon} into the[plural] desolate.
\v 30 Moreover, the Jesus asks-upon same, saying, "What[?] to{you} is-being name[?]" Moreover, the says, "Legion," that many demons comes-into into same,
\v 31 and they-have-been-calling-aside same in-which-place he-would_not_set-upon to{same[plural]} to-come-off/away into the bottomless-depth.
\v 32 Moreover, [a] herd of{sufficient pigs being-grazed} has-been-being there in to{the mountain} and they-have-been-calling-aside same in-which-place he-may-turn-upon to{same} into the-there-s to-come-into, and he-turns-upon to{same}.
\v 33 Moreover, the demons, come[ing]-out from of{the man}, come-into into the pigs, and the herd dashes down of{the precipice} into the lake and is-suffocated-off/away[i.e. drowned].
\v 34 Moreover, the grazing behold[ing] the having-become flee and message-off/away into the city and into the fields.
\v 35 Moreover, they-come-out to-behold the having-become, and come toward the Jesus and discover the man from of{whom} the demons had-come-out being-seated, having-been-outer-garmented, and being-of-sound-disposition beside the feet of{the Jesus}, and they-fear.
\v 36 Moreover, also the behold[ing] message-off/away to{same} how the demonized is-saved,
\v 37 and the emphatically-every multitude of{the region-around} of{the Gadarenes} ask same to-come-off/away-from from of{same}, that to{great fear} they-have-been-having-together; moreover, same, step[ing]-in into the boat, returns.
\v 38 Moreover, the man from of{whom} the demons had-come-out has-been-necessitating of{same} to-be-being together-with to{same}; moreover, the Jesus looses-off/away same, saying,
\v 39 "Be-returning into the house of{you} and be-describing as-much-as the God does to{you}," and he-comes-off/away down/against the whole city, proclaiming as-much-as the Jesus does to{same}.
\v 40 Moreover, it-becomes in to{the} to-return the Jesus, the crowd receives-from same, for all have-been-being esteeming-toward/anticipating same,
\v 41 and behold, [a] man, to{whom} name "Jairus," comes, and same chief of{the gathering[translit. "synagogue"]} has-been-originating-under and, fall[ing] beside the feet of{the Jesus}, has-been-calling-aside same to-come-into into the house of{same},
\v 42 that only-begotten daughter has-been-being to{same} as twelve of{years}, and same has-been-dying-off/away; moreover, in to{the} to-withdrawing same, the crowds have-been-together-stifling same,

\v 44 Come[ing]-toward from-behind, she-takes-hold of{the fringe} of{the outer-garment} of{same} and immediately stands the flow-sis[i.e. state of flow] of{the blood} of{same},
\v 45 and the Jesus says, "Who[?], the take[ing]-hold of{me}[?]" Moreover, of{all denying}, the Peter says, and the alongside of{same}, "Superintendent, the crowds are-together-holding you and are-pressing/constricting-off/away-from and you-are-saying, 'Who[?], the take[ing]-hold of{me}[?]'"
\v 46 Moreover, the Jesus says, "Someone takes-hold of{me}, for I know enablement/empowerment come[ing]-out from of{emphatically-me}."
\v 47 Moreover, the woman behold[ing] that she-does_not_escape-notice, trembling, comes and, fall[ing]-toward to{same}, through whom cause she-takes-hold of{same}, messages-off/away to{same} in-sight of{all the people} and as she-is-cured immediately.
\v 48 Moreover, the says to{same}, "Be-having-courage, daughter. The faith of{you} has-saved you. Be-being-gone into peace."
\v 49 Still of{same speaking}, someone is-being-come beside of{the gathering[translit. "synagogue"]-chief}, saying to{same} that "the daughter of{you} has-died. Do_not_be-hassling the teacher."
\v 50 Moreover, the Jesus, hear[ing], responds to{same}, saying, "Do_not_be-fearing, only be-believing, and she-will-be-saved."
\v 51 Moreover, come[ing]-into into the home he-does_not_let-off to-come-into, not-one, if not Peter and James and John, and the father of{the child} and the mother.
\v 52 Moreover, all have-been-weeping and have-been-striking-selves [regarding] same[feminine]; moreover, the says, "Do_not_be-weeping, for she-does_not_die-off/away; contrariwise, she-is-lying-asleep,"
\v 53 and they-have-been-laughing-down/against of{same}, having-beheld that she-dies-off/away.
\v 54 Moreover, same, cast[ing]-out all outside and, seize[ing] of{the hand} of{same}, sounds, saying, "The child, be-being-roused,"
\v 55 and the spirit of{same} turns-upon, and she-stands-up/anew immediately, and he-sets-through to{same[feminine]} to-be-given to-eat,
\v 56 and the parents of{same} are-astounded; moreover, the messages-aside to{same} to{no-one} to-say the having-become.
\c 9
\v 1 Moreover, call[ing]-together the twelve, he-gives to{same} enablement/empowerment and authority upon all the demons and to-be-healing diseases,
\v 2 and he-sends-off/away same to-be-proclaiming the kingdom of{the God} and to-be-curing the weaknesses/infirmities,
\v 3 and he-says toward same, "Be-lifting nothing into the way, neither staffs, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver-piece, nor two inner-garments to-be-having anew,
\v 4 and into which supposing home you-may-come-into, be-staying there and thence be-being-come-out,
\v 5 and as-many-as supposing may_not_receive you, being-come-out from of{the city, the-there}, shake-off the dust from of{the feet} of{you} into witness upon same."
\v 6 Moreover, being-come-out, they-have-been-being-come-through according-to the villages, good-message-izing and healing everywhere.
\v 7 Moreover, Herod, the fourth-part-origin-ruler[Latin translit. "tetrarch"], hears the being-become all under of{same} and has-been-being-perplexed-through through the to-be-being-said under of{some}, that John has-been-roused out of{dead},
\v 8 moreover under of{some} that Elijah is-revealed, moreover of{others} that [a] prophet into of{the originals} stands-up/anew,
\v 9 and Herod says, "I behead John; moreover, who[?] is-being the-same about of{whom} I am-hearing to-which-the-same[?]," and he-has-been-seeking to-behold same,
\v 10 and, return[ing], the sent-off[one]s describe to{same} as-much-as they-do and, take[ing]-aside same[plural], he-retreats with self [i.e. in private] into [a] desolate place of{[a] city being-called} Bethsaida.
\v 11 Moreover, the crowds, know[ing], accompany to{same} and, receive[ing] same[plural], he-has-been-speaking to{same} about of{the kingdom} of{the God}, and the[plural] having need of{healing} he-has-been-curing.
\v 12 Moreover, the day initiates to-be-leaning; moreover, come[ing]-toward, the twelve say to{same}, "Loose-off/away the crowd, in-which-place, come[ing]-off/away into the to{round-about} villages and the fields, they-may-loose-down[i.e. retire] and may-discover upon-grain/provision, that we-are-being here in to{[a] desolate place}."
\v 13 Moreover, he-says toward same, "You, give to{same} to-eat." Moreover, the[plural] say, "Much-more than five breads and two fishes are_not_being to{us}, if not-what, be[ing]-gone, we may-purchase into all the people, the-same, consume-effects,"
\v 14 for [there]have-been-being as-if five-thousand men. Moreover, he-says toward the disciples of{same}, "Lay-down same[plural], companies fifty anew,"
\v 15 and they-do the-same-ly, and recline emphatically-all.
\v 16 Moreover, take[ing] the five breads and the two fishes, view[ing]-up into the heaven, he-good-words same and breaks-down and has-been-giving to{the disciples} to-be-placed-aside to{the crowd},
\v 17 and they-eat and all are-fed-ized, and the exceed[ing] to{same} of{break-effects/fragments} is-lifted, twelve baskets,
\v 18 and it-becomes in to{the} to-be-being, same, praying, with-only/alone, the disciples have-been-being-together to{same}, and he-asks-upon same, saying, "Who[?] the crowds are-saying me to-be-being[?]"
\v 19 Moreover, the respond[ing] say, "John, the immerser; moreover, others, Elijah; moreover, others that [a] prophet, who of{the originals}, stands-up/anew."
\v 20 Moreover, he-says to{same}, "Moreover, who[?] you are-saying me to-be-being[?]" Moreover, the Peter, respond[ing], says, "The Anointed of{the God}."
\v 21 Moreover, the, adjudge[ing]-valuation-upon to{same}, messages-aside to-say the-same to{no-one},
\v 22 say[ing] that it-is-necessitating the son of{the man} to-suffer many and to-be-esteem-ized-off/away[i.e. be rejected] from of{the elders} and of{chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests]} and of{scribes}, and to-be-killed-off/away, and to{the third day} to-be-roused.
\v 23 Moreover, he-has-been-saying toward all, "If any is-will-ing behind of{me} to-come: deny-off/away sameself and lift the cross of{same} according-to day [i.e. day by day] and be-accompanying to{me},
\v 24 for who supposing may-be-will-ing the life of{same} to-save will-destroy-off/away same; moreover, who supposing may-destroy-off/away the life of{same} because of{emphatically-me}, the-same will-save same,
\v 25 for what[?] is-being-profited, [a] man gain[ing] the whole world, moreover destroy[ing]-off/away sameself or penalized[?],
\v 26 for who supposing may-be-ashamed-upon me and the my words, the-same, the son of{the man} will-be-ashamed-upon when-supposing he-may-come in to{the esteem/glory} of{same} and of{the father} and of{the holy messengers}.
\v 27 Moreover, I-am-saying to{you}, truly some are-being of{the thus having-stood} who, no, should_not_taste of{death} until supposing they-may-behold the kingdom of{the God}."
\v 28 Moreover, it-becomes alongside the words, the-same, as-if eight days and, take[ing]-aside Peter and John and James, he-ascends into the mountain to-pray,
\v 29 and it-becomes in to{the} to-be-praying same, the behold of{the face} of{same} different-other, and the outer-garment-set of{same} flashing-out[like lightning] white/bright,
\v 30 and, behold, two men have-been-speaking-together to{same}; the-who have-been-being Moses and Elijah,
\v 31 who, seen in to{esteem/glory}, have-been-saying the way-out of{same[masculine singular]} he-has-been-being-about which to-be-fulfilling in Jerusalem.
\v 32 Moreover, the Peter and the together-with to{same} have-been-being having-been-weighted to{sleep}. Moreover, be[ing]-through-awake, they-behold the esteem/glory of{same} and the two men, the having-stood-together to{same[singular]},
\v 33 and it-becomes in to{the} to-be-separating-through same from of{same} the Peter says toward the Jesus, "Superintendent, it-is-being good, us, to-be-being here, and we-should-make three tents, one to{you} and one to{Moses} and one to{Elijah}," no having-beheld the he-is-saying.
\v 34 Moreover, of{same saying} the-same, [a] cloud becomes and shadows-upon same. Moreover, they-fear in to{the} the-there-s to-come-into into the cloud,
\v 35 and [a] sound becomes out of{the cloud}, saying, "The-same is-being the Son of{me}, the beloved. Be-hearing of{same},"
\v 36 and in to{the} to-become the sound, only the Jesus is-discovered, and same[plural] refrain-from-speaking and to{not-one} they-message-off/away in to{the-there-s, the days} nothing of{whom} they-have-seen.
\v 37 Moreover, it-becomes in to{the next day} of{same come[ing]-down} from of{the mountain} [a] vast crowd meets-together to{same},
\v 38 and behold, [a] man from of{the crowd} cries-up/anew, saying, "Teacher, I-am-being-necessitated of{you} to-view-upon upon the son of{me}, that he-is-being only-begotten to{me},
\v 39 and behold, [a] spirit is-taking same and out-suddenly/unexpectedly is-crying-out, and is-convulsing same alongside of{foam} and excruciatingly it-is-separating-off/away-from from of{same}, wearing-down-together same,
\v 40 and I-am-necessitated of{the disciples} of{you} in-which-place they-may-cast-out same, and they-are_not_enabled/empowered."
\v 41 Moreover, respond[ing], the Jesus says, "Oh generation unbelieving[adjective] and having-been-through-turned/twisted/distorted. Until at-what-time[?] I-will-be toward you and will-hold/be-held-up/anew of{you}[?] Lead-toward here the son of{you}."
\v 42 Moreover, still of{being-come-toward same} the demon tears same and together-convulses; moreover, the Jesus adjudges-valuation-upon to{the spirit, the unclean} and cures the child and gives-off/away same to{the father} of{same}.
\v 43 Moreover, all have-been-being-impacted upon to{the magnificence} of{the God}. Moreover, of{all marveling} upon to{all which} the Jesus does, he-says toward the disciples of{same},
\v 44 "You, place into the ears of{you} the words, the-same, for the son of{the man} is-being-about to-be-being-given-aside/delivered into [the] hands of{men}."
\v 45 Moreover, the[plural] have-been-without-knowing the say-effect/statement, the-same, and has-been-being having-been-covered-aside from of{same} in-which-place they-would_not_perceive same and they-have-been-fearing to-ask same about of{the say-effect/statement, the-same}.
\v 46 Moreover, [a] dialog-iz-ation comes-into in to{same[plural]}, the who[singular] supposing might-be-being greater of{same[plural]}.
\v 47 Moreover, the Jesus, behold[ing] the dialog-iz-ation of{the heart} of{same[plural]}, take[ing]-upon of{[a] childling}, stands same beside to{sameself}
\v 48 and says to{same[plural]}, "Who if-supposing may-receive the-same, the childling, upon to{the name} of{me} is-receiving emphatically-me, and who if-supposing may-receive emphatically-me is-receiving the send[ing]-off-away me, for the lesser in to{all you} originating-under[i.e. being subordinated to], the-same will-be great."
\v 49 Moreover, respond[ing], the John says, "Superintendent, we-behold someone upon to{the name} of{you} casting-out demons, and we-hinder same, that he-is_not_accompanying alongside of{us},"
\v 50 and the Jesus says toward same, "Do_not_be-hindering, for who is_not_being against of{you} is-being over/for-the-sake of{you}."
\v 51 Moreover, it-becomes in to{the} to-be-being-together-fulfilled the days of{the taking-up-sis[i.e. state of taking up]} of{same} and same establishes the face of{same} of{the} to-be-being-gone into Jerusalem,
\v 52 and he-sends-off/away messengers before of{face} of{same} and, be[ing]-gone, they-come-into into [a] village of{Samaritans} such-as to-prepare to{same},
\v 53 and they-do_not_receive same, that the face of{same} has-been-being being-gone into Jerusalem.
\v 54 Moreover, behold[ing], the disciples of{same}, James and John, say, "Lord, you-are-will-ing we-may-say fire to-descend from of{the heaven} and to-devour same as also Elijah does."
\v 55 Moreover, turned, he-adjudges-valuation-upon to{same} and says, "You-have_not_beheld of{the-which spirit} you-are-being;
\v 56 the son of{the man} does_not_come to-destroy-off/away [the] lives of{men}; contrariwise, to-save," and they-are-gone into [a] different-other village.
\v 57 Moreover, it-becomes, of{same being-gone} in to{the way}, someone says toward same, "I-will-accompany to{you} which-where supposing you-may-be-being-come-off/away, Lord,"
\v 58 and the Jesus says to{same}, "The foxes are-having dens and the flying-creatures of{the heaven} roosts; moreover, the son of{the man} is_not_having where he-may-be-leaning the head."
\v 59 Moreover, he-says toward [a] different-other, "Be-accompanying to{me}." Moreover, the says, "Lord, turn-upon to{me, come[ing]-off/away}, first to-bury the father of{me}."
\v 60 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "Let-off/away the dead to-bury the dead of{sameselves}. Moreover, you, come[ing]-off/away, be-through-messaging the kingdom of{the God}."
\v 61 Moreover, also [a] different-other says, "I-will-accompany to{you}, Lord; moreover, first turn-upon to{me} to-set-such-as-to-be-set-off/away to{the} into the house of{me}."
\v 62 Moreover, the Jesus says toward same, "Not-one cast[ing]-upon the hand of{same} upon [the] plow and viewing into the behind is-being well-placed into the kingdom of{the God}."
\c 10
\v 1 Moreover, alongside the-same, the Lord shows-anew/appoints also seventy different-others and sends-off/away same two anew before of{face} of{same} into every city and place of{which} same[singular] has-been-being-about to-be-being-come.
\v 2 So, he-has-been-saying toward same, "On-one-hand the harvest much; on-the-other-hand the workers few. So, be-necessitated of{the Lord} of{the harvest}, which-how may-cast-out workers into the harvest of{same}.
\v 3 Be-withdrawing. Behold, I am-sending-off/away you as lambs in to{midst} of{wolves}.
\v 4 Do_not_be-bearing[weight] [a] purse, no bag, nor footwear, also, you-may-greet/be-greeted no-one down the way.
\v 5 Moreover, into which supposing home you-may-be-being-come-into, first be-saying, 'Peace to{the house, the-same},'
\v 6 and if-supposing [a] son of{peace} may-be-being there, the peace of{you} will-rest-upon upon same; moreover, if no-indeed upon you it-will-turn-back/anew.
\v 7 Moreover, in to{same, the home}, be-staying, eating and drinking the beside of{same}, for the worker of{the wage} of{same} is-being worthwhile. Do_not_be-changing-course out of{home} into home,
\v 8 and into which supposing you-may-be-being-come-into [a] city and they-may-be-receiving you, be-eating the being-placed-beside to{you},
\v 9 and be-healing the infirm in to{same} and be-saying to{same}, 'The kingdom of{the God} has-become-near upon you.'
\v 10 Moreover, into which supposing city you-may-be-being-come-into and they-may_not_be-receiving you, come[ing]-out into the broad[space]s of{same}, say,
\v 11 'Also the dust, the adhered to{us} out of{the city} of{you} we-are-wiping-off to{you}. More-ly be-knowing the-same, that the kingdom of{the God} has-become-near upon you.'
\v 12 I-am-saying to{you} that it-will-be more-endurable to{Sodoms} in to{the day, the-there} than to{the city, the-there}.
\v 13 Woe to{you}, Chorazin, woe to{you}, Bethsaida, that if in to{Tyre} and to{Sidon} are-become the empowerments, the be[ing]-become in to{you}, long-ago supposing, they-change-minds/thinking being-seated in to{sackcloth} and to{ash}.
\v 14 More-ly, it-will-be more-endurable to{Tyre} and to{Sidon} in to{the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]} than to{you},
\v 15 and you, Capernaum, the until of{the heaven} elevated, until of{unseen/Hades}, you-will-be-step-ized-down/descended.
\v 16 The hearing of{you} is-hearing of{emphatically-me}, and the un-placing/rejecting you is-un-placing/rejecting emphatically-me; moreover, the un-placing/rejecting emphatically-me is-un-placing/rejecting the send[ing]-off/away me."
\v 17 Moreover, the seventy return alongside of{joy}, saying, "Lord, also the demons, it-is-being-set-under/subjected to{us} in to{the name} of{you}."
\v 18 Moreover, he-says to{same}, "I-have-been-observing the Satan/adversary as lightning fall[ing] out of{the heaven}.
\v 19 Behold, I-have-given to{you} the authority of{the} to-be-treading up-upon of{serpents} and of{scorpions} and upon all the enablement/empowerment of{the hostile}, and nothing, no, would_not_do-injustice-to/injure you.
\v 20 More-ly, in to{the-same} do_not_be-joying that the spirits, it-is-being-set-under/subjected to{you}; moreover, be-joying that, the names of{you}, it-is-written in to{the heavens}."
\v 21 In to{the same hour} the Jesus exults-self to{the Spirit} and says, "I-am-acknowledging-self-out to{you}, Father, Lord of{the heaven} and of{the earth}, that you-conceal-from, the-same, from of{wise} and of{put-together/intelligent} and you-off-cover/uncover same to{infant}. Yes, oh Father, that the-same-ly becomes well-esteem-ia/inclination in-front of{you},"
\v 22 and, turned toward the disciples, he-says, "All is-given-aside/delivered to{me} under of{the Father} of{me}, and no-one is-knowing who is-being the Son if not the Father, and who is-being the Father, if not the son, and to{whom} if-supposing he-may-be-intending the Son to-off-cover/uncover,"
\v 23 and, turned toward the disciples with self [i.e. in private], he-says, "Blessed, the eyes, the viewing, what you-are-viewing,
\v 24 for I-am-saying to{you} that many prophets and kings will to-behold what you are-viewing, and do_not_behold, and to-hear what you-are-hearing and do_not_hear,"
\v 25 and, behold, some lawyer stands-up, trial-izing-out same and saying, "Teacher, do[ing] what[?] I-will-inherit eternal being-alive[noun][?]"
\v 26 Moreover, the says toward same, "It-has-been-written what[?] in to{the law}[?] How[?] you-are-knowing-anew[?]"
\v 27 Moreover, respond[ing], the says, "You-will-love [the] Lord, the God of{you}, out of{the whole heart} of{you} and out of{the whole life} of{you} and out of{the whole strength} of{you} and out of{the whole mind/thinking-through} of{you}, and the nearby of{you} as yourself."
\v 28 Moreover, he-says to{same}, "Straight-up-ly you-respond. Be-doing the-same and you-will-be-alive."
\v 29 Moreover, the, will-ing to-be-justifying sameself, says toward the Jesus, "And who[?] is-being nearby of{me}[?]"
\v 30 Moreover, take[ing]-under, the Jesus says, "Some man has-been-descending from Jerusalem into Jericho and falls-around/about to{robbers} who, also, out-clothe[ing]/disrobe[ing] same, also place[ing]-upon blows, come-off/away, let[ing]-off/away half-dead. Occurring,
\v 31 moreover, according-to together-happen/coincidence, some consecrated[i.e. priest] has-been-descending in to{the way, the-there} and, behold[ing] same, comes-opposite-aside.
\v 32 Moreover, similarly, also [a] Levite, become[ing] according-to the place, come[ing], also behold[ing], comes-opposite-aside.
\v 33 Moreover, some Samaritan, traveling, comes according-to same and, behold[ing] same, is-affected-inwardly[i.e. feels compassion],
\v 34 and, come[ing]-toward, binds-down/against the wound-effects of{same}, pouring-upon olive-oil and wine. Moreover, step-ize[ing]-upon/mount[ing]-upon same upon the own livestock/animal, he-leads same into [an] inn and is-concerned-upon/takes-care of{same},
\v 35 and upon the next-day, come[ing]-out, cast[ing]-out two denarii, he-gives to{the innkeeper} and says to{same}, 'Be-concerned-upon/take-care of{same} and the what supposing you-may-spend-toward, I will-give-off/away to{you} in to{the} to-be-being-upon-come-anew[i.e. come back again] me.'
\v 36 So, who[?] of{the-same[plural], the three}, to{you} is-esteeming to-have-become nearby of{the fall[ing]-in} into the robbers[?]"
\v 37 Moreover, the says, "The do[ing] the mercy alongside of{same}." Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "Be-being-gone; also you, be-doing similarly."
\v 38 Moreover, it-becomes, in to{the} to-be-being-gone same, and same comes-into into some village, moreover some woman to{name} "Martha" under-receives same into the house of{same},
\v 39 and to{she-here} has-been-being [a] sister being-called Mary who, also sit[ing]-down-beside beside the feet of{the Jesus} has-been-hearing the word of{same}.
\v 40 Moreover, the Martha has-been-being-drawn-around around much service. Moreover, stand[ing]-upon, she-says, "Lord, it-is_not_concerning to{you} that the sister of{me} leaves-behind me alone to-be-serving[?] So, say to{same} in-which-place she-may-take-together-in-place[i.e. assist] to{me}."
\v 41 Moreover, respond[ing], the Jesus says to{same}, "Martha, Martha, you-are-worrying and are-being-stirred-up about many;
\v 42 moreover, of{one} need is-being; moreover, Mary chooses the beneficial part which-what will_not_be-lifted-off/away-from from of{same},"
\c 11
\v 1 and it-becomes in to{the} to-be-being same in to{some place} praying, as he-stops/pauses, someone of{the disciples} of{same} says toward same, "Lord, teach us to-be-praying according-as also John teaches the disciples of{same}."
\v 2 Moreover, he-says to{same}, "When-supposing you-may-be-praying, be-saying, 'Father of{us}, the in to{the heavens}, the name of{you}: be-holy-ized. The kingdom of{you}: be-come. The will-effect of{you}: be-become, as in to{heaven} and/also upon of{the earth}.
\v 3 Be-giving to{us} the bread of{us}, the upon-substance, the according-to[i.e. per] day,
\v 4 and let-off/away to{us} the sins of{us}; for also same[we] are-letting-off/away to{every owing} to{us}, and you-would_not_carry-into us into trial-ization; contrariwise, rescue us from of{the evil},'"
\v 5 and he-says toward same, "Who[?] out of{you} will-have [a] friend and will-be-gone toward same of{mid-night} and may-say to{same}, 'Friend, lend to{me} three breads,
\v 6 upon-beheld[conjunction] [a] friend of{me} becomes-aside out of{[the] way} toward me, and I-am_not_having what I-will-set-aside to{same},'
\v 7 and-the-there, inside, respond[ing], may-say, 'Be_not_having-aside/presenting toils to{me}. Already the door has-been-closed and the childlings of{me} alongside of{emphatically-me} are-being into the [marriage/family]bed. I-am_not_being-enabled, stand[ing]-up/anew, to-give to{you}.'
\v 8 I-am-saying to{you} if also he-will_not_give to{same} stand[ing]-up/anew through the friend to-be-being of{same}, yet through the shameless-ia/shamelessness of{same}, roused, he-will-give to{same} as-much-as he-is-needing,
\v 9 and-I am-saying to{you}, be-giving-cause/requesting and it-will-be-given to{you}, be-seeking and you-will-discover, be-knocking and it-will-be-opened-anew to{you},
\v 10 for every, the giving-cause/requesting, is-taking, and the seeking, is-discovering, and to{the knocking}, it-will-be-opened-anew.
\v 11 Moreover, the some father out of{you}, the son will-give-cause-for/request bread. He-will_not_upon-give [a] stone to{same}; or also fish, not in-place-of of{fish} he-will-upon-give [a] serpent to{same}.
\v 12 Or also if-supposing he-may-give-cause-for/request [an] egg, he-will_not_upon-give [a] scorpion to{same}.
\v 13 So, if you, evil originating-under, have-beheld beneficial give-effects to-be-giving to{the offsprings} of{you}, to{how-much} more the Father, the out of{heaven} will-give [the] Holy Spirit to{the giving-cause-to/requesting} same,"
\v 14 and he-has-been-being casting-out [a] demon, and same has-been-being deaf/mute. Moreover, it-becomes of{the demon come[ing]-out} the deaf/mute speaks, and the crowds marvel.
\v 15 Moreover, some out of{same} say, "In to{Ba'al-Zebub, chief} of{the demons} he-is-casting-out the demons."
\v 16 Moreover, different-others, trial-izing, have-been-seeking [a] sign out of{heaven} beside of{same}.
\v 17 Moreover, same having-beheld the through-mind/thinking-effects[i.e. thoughts] of{same} says to{same}, "Every kingdom be[ing]-divided-through upon sameself is-being-desolated, and house upon house is-falling.
\v 18 Moreover, if also the Satan/adversary is-divided-through upon sameself, how[?] will-be-stood, the kingdom of{same}, that you-are-saying me, in to{Ba'al-Zebub} to-be-casting-out the demons[?]
\v 19 Moreover, if I am-casting-out the demons in to{Ba'al-Zebub}, in to{whom[?]} the sons of{you} are-casting-out[?] Through the-same, judges of{you} will-be same[plural].
\v 20 Moreover, if I-am-casting-out the demons in to{[the] finger} of{God}, consequently, the kingdom of{the God} precedes/overtakes upon you.
\v 21 When-supposing the strong, having-been-armed-against, may-be-guarding the courtyard of{sameself}, in to{peace} is-being the[plural] originating-under of{same}.
\v 22 Moreover, upon-supposing the stronger of{same}, come[ing]-upon, may-conquer same, he-is-lifting the all-arms/weapon-ia/panoply of{same} upon to{which} he-had-had-confidence-upon and is-giving-through/distributing the spoils of{same}.
\v 23 The not being alongside of{emphatically-me} is-being against of{emphatically-me} and the not gathering alongside of{emphatically-me} is-scattering.
\v 24 When-supposing the unclean spirit may-come-out from of{the man}, it-is-being-come-through through of{waterless places}, seeking rest and, not discovering, it-is-saying, 'I-will-return into the house of{me} whence I-come-out,'
\v 25 and, come[ing], it-is-discovering being-vacant, having-been-swept, and having-been-arranged/ordered.
\v 26 Then it-is-being-gone and is-taking-along seven different-other spirits, more-evil-than of{sameself} and, come[ing]-into, is-housing-down there, and the last of{the man, the-there} is-being-become worse-than of{the first}."
\v 27 Moreover, it-becomes in to{the} to-be-saying same[masculine], the-same[neuter plural], some woman, sound lift[ing]-upon out of{the crowd}, says to{same}, "Blessed, the cavity-ia, the bear[ing] you, and breasts which you-nurse."
\v 28 Moreover, same says, "Yet,-so,-on-the-other-hand, blessed, the hearing the word of{the God} and guarding same."
\v 29 Moreover, of{the crowds being-assembled-upon}, he-initiates to-be-saying, "The same generation is-being evil. It-is-seeking-upon [a] sign, and [a] sign will_not_be-given same if not the sign of{Jonah the prophet},
\v 30 for according-as Jonah becomes [a] sign to{the Ninevites}, the-same-ly the son of{the man} will-be also to{the generation, the-same}.
\v 31 [The] queen of{[the] south/southwest} will-be-roused in to{the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]} alongside of{the men} of{the generation, the-same} and will-judge-against same, that she-comes out of{the limits} of{the earth} to-hear the wisdom of{Solomon} and, behold, more-than of{Solomon} here.
\v 32 Men, Ninevites, will-stand-up/anew in to{the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]} alongside of{the generation, the-same}, and will-judge-against same, that they-change-mind/thinking into the proclaim-effect of{Jonah} and, behold, more-than of{Jonah} here.
\v 33 Moreover, no-one kindle[ing] [a] lamp is-placing into hidden[adjective], nor under the basket-measure; contrariwise, upon the lampstand, in-which-place the being-gone-into may-be-viewing the light.
\v 34 The lamp of{the body} is-being the eye. So, when-supposing the eye of{you} may-be-being simple/plain/straightforward, also the whole body of{you} is-being luminous. Moreover, upon-supposing it-may-be-being evil, also the body of{you} dark.
\v 35 So, be-watching, lest the light, the in to{you}, is-being darkness.
\v 36 So, if the whole body of{you} luminous, not having any part dark, [the] whole will-be luminous, as when-supposing the lamp to{the lightning/flash} may-be-light-izing you."
\v 37 Moreover, in to{the} to-speak, some Pharisee has-been-asking same which-how he-may-have-breakfast/lunch beside to{same}. Moreover, come[ing]-into, he-falls-anew[i.e. sits down].
\v 38 Moreover, the Pharisee, behold[ing], marvels that not first he-is-immersed before of{the breakfast/lunch}.
\v 39 Moreover, the Lord says toward same, "Now you, the Pharisees, are-cleansing the outwardly of{the cup} and of{the platter}; moreover, the inwardly of{you} is-brimming of{seizure[i.e. taking from]} and of{evil-ia}.
\v 40 Imprudent[one]s, not the make[ing] the outwardly also makes the inwardly[?]
\v 41 More-ly, give the being-in mercy-ness/charity-ness and, behold, all is-being clean to{you}.
\v 42 Contrariwise, woe to{you, the Pharisees}, that you-are-tenth-ing-off/away-from the sweet-smelling/mint and the rue and every herb, and you-are-being-come-aside the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment], and the love of{the God}. He/it-has-been-necessitating the-same to-do, and-the-there not to-be-letting-off/away-from.
\v 43 Woe to{you, the Pharisees}, that you-are-loving the first-seat in to{the gatherings[translit. 'synagogues']} and the greetings in to{the marketplaces}.
\v 44 Woe to{you}, scribes and Pharisees, pretenders, that you-are-being as the memorials, the un-evident, and the men, walking-around up-upon, have_not_beheld."
\v 45 Moreover, respond[ing], someone of{the lawyers} is-saying to{same}, "Teacher, saying the-same, you-are-rampaging us also."
\v 46 Moreover, the says, "Also to{you, the lawyers}, woe, that you-are-load-izing the men hard-to-bear loads, and same are_not_toward-touching to{one} of{the fingers} of{you} to{the loads}.
\v 47 Woe to{you}, that you-are-house-building the memorials of{the prophets}; moreover, the fathers of{you} kill-off/away same.
\v 48 Consequently, you-are-witnessing and you-are-being-well-esteemed-together to{the works} of{the fathers} of{you}, that same on-one-hand kill-off/away same; on-the-other-hand, you are-house-building the memorials of{same}.
\v 49 Through the-same also the wisdom of{the God} says, 'I-will-send-off/away into same prophets and sent-off/away[one]s, and out of{same} they-will-kill-off/away and they-will-chase-out,'
\v 50 in-which-place the blood of{all the prophets}, the being-poured-out from of{[the] cast-down} of{[the] world}, may-be-sought-out from of{the generation, the-same},
\v 51 from of{the blood} [of-]Abel until of{the blood} of{Zechariah, the perished-off/away} between of{the sacrifice-place[i.e. altar]} and of{the house}. Yes, I-am-saying to{you}, it-will-be-sought-out from of{the generation, the-same}.
\v 52 Woe to{you, the lawyers}, that you-lift the key of{the knowledge}. Same[you plural] do_not_come-into, and you-hinder the being-come-into."
\v 53 Moreover, of{same saying} the-same[neuter plural] toward same[masculine plural], the scribes and the Pharisees initiate to-be-holding-in terribly and to-be-mouth-off-izing same about of{much-more},
\v 54 ambush-planning same and seeking to-hunt something out of{the mouth} of{same} in-which-place they-may-accuse of{same},
\c 12
\v 1 in to{which} of{gather[ing]-upon} of{the ten-thousand} of{the crowd} such-as to-be-walking-down/against[i.e. trampling] one-another, he-initiates to-be-saying toward the disciples of{same} first, "Be-holding-toward to{sameselves} from of{the leaven} of{the Pharisees}, which-what is-being pretense.
\v 2 Moreover, nothing having-been-covered-together is-being the will_not_be-off-covered, and [the] hidden[adjective] the will_not_be-known,
\v 3 to-the-contrary of{which}, as-much-as in to{the darkness-ia} you-say, in to{the light} will-be-heard, and the toward the ear you-speak in to{the inner-rooms} will-be-proclaimed upon of{the buildings}.
\v 4 Moreover, I-am-saying to{you, the friends} of{me}, do_not_fear from of{the killing-off/away} the body and alongside the-same not of{having} more-excessive what to-do.
\v 5 Moreover, I-will-show-under to{you} whom you-should-fear. Fear the, alongside the to-kill-off/away, having authority to-cast-in into the Gehenna. Yes, I-am-saying to{you}, fear the-same.
\v 6 Emphatically-not five sparrows is-being-sold of{two assarii[Roman coins]} and one out of{same} is_not_being having-been-forgotten in-sight of{the God}.
\v 7 Contrariwise, also the hairs of{the head} of{you} all have-been-numbered, so do_not_be-fearing; you-are-carrying-through/surpassing of{many sparrows}.
\v 8 Moreover, I-am-saying to{you}, every who supposing may-same-word/acknowledge in to{emphatically-me} in-front of{the men}, also the son of{the man} will-same-word/acknowledge in to{same} in-front of{the messengers} of{the God}.
\v 9 Moreover, the deny[ing] me in-sight of{the men} will-be-denied-off/away in-sight of{the messengers} of{the God},
\v 10 and every, who will-say [a] word into the son of{the man}, it-will-be-let-off/away to{same}; moreover, to{the assert[ing]-evil} into the Holy Spirit, it-will_not_be-let-off/away.
\v 11 Moreover, when-supposing they-may-be-toward-carrying you upon the gatherings[translit. 'synagogues'] and the chiefs and the authorities, you-should_not_worry how or what you-may-defend-selves or what you-may-say,
\v 12 for the Holy Spirit will-teach you in to{the same hour} what is-necessitating to-say."
\v 13 Moreover, someone out of{the crowd} says to{same}, "Teacher, say to{the brother} of{me} to-divide alongside of{emphatically-me} the inheritance."
\v 14 Moreover, the says to{same}, "Man, who[?] stands/sets-down me justice[role] or divider upon you[?]"
\v 15 Moreover, he-says toward same[plural], "Be-seeing and be-guarding from of{the greater-having-ia}, that not in to{the} to-be-exceeding to{which} the being-alive[noun] of{same} is-being out of{the[plural] undertaking} of{same}."
\v 16 Moreover, he-says [a] parable toward same, saying, "The region of{some rich man} carries/bears-well,
\v 17 and he-has-been-being-dialog-ized in to{sameself}, saying, 'What[?] I-may-do, that I-am_not_having where[?] I-will-gather the fruits of{me}[?],'
\v 18 and he-says, 'I-will-do the-same[i.e. this:]. I-will-lift-down of{me} the storehouses and will-house-build larger, and I-will-gather there all the become-effects of{me} and the beneficial of{me},
\v 19 and I-will-say to{the life} of{me}, "Life, you-are-having many beneficial being-lain into many years. Be-resting-self, eat, drink, be-being-gladdened."'
\v 20 Moreover, the God says to{same}, 'Imprudent, to{the-same, the night}, they-are-giving-cause-to/requesting-off/away-from from of{you} the life of{you}. Moreover, what you-prepare, to{whom} it-will-be[?]'
\v 21 The-same-ly the wealth-izing to{sameself} and not being-rich into God."
\v 22 Moreover, he-says toward the disciples of{same}, "Through the-same I-am-saying to{you}, do_not_be-worrying to{the life} of{you}, what you-may-eat, nor to{the body}, what you-may-clothe-selves,
\v 23 for the life is-being more-than of{the nourishment} and the body of{the clothing}.
\v 24 Think-according-to/consider the ravens, that they-are_not_sowing nor are-harvesting, to{which} [there]is_not_being inner-room nor storehouse, and the God is-nourishing same. To{how-much} more you are-carrying-through/surpassing of{the flying-creatures}.
\v 25 Moreover, who[?] out of{you} of{worries} is-being-enabled to-place-toward upon the stature of{same} one cubit[?]
\v 26 So, if you-are-being-enabled not-besides [the] least, what[?] about of{the remaining} you-are-worrying[?]
\v 27 Think-according-to/consider the lilies, how it-is-growing. It-is_not_toiling nor is-spinning; moreover, I-am-saying to{you} neither Solomon in to{all the esteem/glory} of{same} drapes-around-self as one of{the-same}.
\v 28 Moreover, if the God the-same-ly is-dress-ing the grass being in to{[the] field} today and being-cast the-next-day into [an] oven, to{how-much[?]} more you, scant[of]faith[?],
\v 29 and you, do_not_be-seeking what you-may-eat or what you-may-drink, and do_not_be-being-in-suspense,
\v 30 for all the nations of{the world} is-seeking-upon the-same[plural]; moreover, the Father of{you} has-beheld that you-are-needing of{the-same}.
\v 31 More-ly, be-seeking the kingdom of{the God} and the-same all will-be-placed-toward to{you}.
\v 32 Do_not_be-fearing, the little shepherded[flock]-let, that the Father of{you} well-esteems to-give to{you} the kingdom.
\v 33 Sell the[plural] originating-under of{you} and give mercy-ness/charity-ness. Make to{sameselves} purses not being-old-ed, wealth without-quit-out-ible/inexhaustible in to{the heavens} which-where thief is_not_becoming-near nor moth is-ruining-through,
\v 34 for which-where the wealth of{you} is-being, there also the heart of{you} will-be.
\v 35 The hips/loins of{you}: be-being having-been-girded-around, and the lamps being-ignited,
\v 36 and you, analogous to{men receiving-toward} the Lord of{sameselves}, at-what-time he-will-loose-up/anew out of{the weddings} in-which-place, of{come[ing]} and of{knock[ing]} straightaway they-may-open-up to{same}.
\v 37 Blessed, the slaves, the-there-s, whom, come[ing], the Lord will-discover being-awake. Amen I-am-saying to{you} that he-will-be-girded-around and will-recline same and, come[ing]-aside, will-serve to{same},
\v 38 and if-supposing he-may-come in to{the second custody[i.e. time period]}, and in to{the third custody[i.e. time period]} he-may-come and may-discover the-same-ly, blessed are-being the slaves, the-there-s.
\v 39 Moreover, be-knowing the-same, that if the house-ruler had-beheld to{about-what-such hour} the thief is-being-come, he-is-awake, also supposing he-does_not_let-off/away to-be-dug-through, the house of{same}.
\v 40 So, also you be-becoming ready, that to{which hour} you-are_not_esteeming, the son of{the man} is-being-come."
\v 41 Moreover, the peter says to{same}, "Lord, you-are-speaking the parable, the-same, toward us, or also toward all[?]"
\v 42 Moreover, the Lord says, "Who[?], consequently, is-being the faithful house-legislator, and prudent, whom the lord will-stand/set-down upon of{the healing/therapy/treatment/attendance} of{same}, of{the} to-be-giving in to{season} the grain-measure[?]
\v 43 Blessed, the slave, the-there, whom the lord of{same}, come[ing], will-discover doing the-same-ly.
\v 44 Truly I-am-saying to{you} that upon to{all the[plural] originating-under} of{same} he-will-stand/set-down same.
\v 45 Moreover, if-supposing the slave, the-there, may-say in to{the heart} of{same}, 'The lord of{me} is-time-izing[i.e. taking his time] to-be-being-come,' and may-initiate to-be-beating the children and the girlies, both to-be-eating and to-be-drinking and to-be-being-drunk,
\v 46 the lord of{the slave, the-there}, will-arrive in to{[a] day which} he-is_not_esteeming-toward/anticipating and in to{[an] hour which} he-is_not_knowing, and he-will-slice/separate same and will-place the portion of{same} alongside of{the unbelieving/unfaithful}.
\v 47 Moreover, the slave, the-there, the know[ing] the will-effect of{the lord} of{sameself} and not prepare[ing] nor do[ing] toward the will-effect of{same} will-be-flayed many.
\v 48 Moreover, the not know[ing], moreover do[ing] worthy of{blows}, will-be-flayed few; moreover, to{every whom} is-given much, much will-be-sought beside of{same}, and to{whom[singular]} they-are-placed-beside-such-as-to-place-beside much, more-excessive will-be-given-cause/requested same.
\v 49 I-come to-cast fire upon the earth, and what I-am-will-ing, if already it-is-kindled-anew.
\v 50 Moreover, I-am-having [an] immerse-effect to-be-immersed, and how I-am-being-held-together until of{which} it-may-be-completed.
\v 51 You-are-esteeming that I-become-near to-give peace in to{the earth}; emphatically-not, I-am-saying to{you}; contrariwise, rather, division-through,
\v 52 for will-be, from of{the} now, five in to{one house} having-been-divided-through, three upon to{two} and two upon to{three}.
\v 53 Father will-be-divided-through upon to{son} and son upon to{father}, mother upon to{daughter} and daughter upon to{mother}, mother-in-law upon the bride/daughter-in-law of{same} and bride/daughter-in-law upon the mother-in-law of{same}."
\v 54 Moreover, he-has-been-saying also to{the crowds}, "When-supposing you-may-behold [a] cloud completing-up from of{settings/[west]}, straightaway you-are-saying, '[A] rainstorm is-being-come,' and it-is-becoming the-same-ly,
\v 55 and when-supposing blowing south/southwest you-are-saying that it-will-be burning-heat, and it-is-becoming.
\v 56 Pretenders! You-have-beheld the face of{the earth} and of{the heaven} to-be-esteem-izing/evaluating; moreover, how[?] you-are_not_esteem-izing/evaluating the season, the-same[?]
\v 57 Moreover, what[?] also from of{sameselves} you-are_not_judging the just[?],
\v 58 for as you-are-withdrawing alongside of{the litigant} of{you} upon [a] chief/ruler/magistrate, give work-ia/business in to{the way} to-have-been-altered-off/away/released/absolved from of{same}, not-whereby he-may-drag-down you toward the judge and the judge may-give-aside/deliver you to{the executor} and the executor may-cast you into custody.
\v 59 I-am-saying to{you}, no, you-would_not_come-out thence until of{which} also you-would-give-off the last mite."
\c 13
\v 1 Moreover, some have-been-being-aside/present in to{same, the season}, messaging-off to{same} about of{the Galileans}, the blood of{whom} Pilate mixes alongside of{the sacrifices} of{same[plural]},
\v 2 and, respond[ing], the Jesus says to{same}, "You-are-esteeming that the Galileans, the-same, become sinful aside all the Galileans, that they-have-suffered to-which-the-same.
\v 3 Emphatically-not, I-am-saying to{you}; contrariwise, if-supposing you-should_not_be-changing-mind/thinking, [you] all similarly will-perish-off/away.
\v 4 Or, the ten and eight, the-there-s, upon whom the tower in to{the} Siloam falls and kills-off/away same. You-are-esteeming that the-same owe-ers become, aside all men, the housing-down in Jerusalem.
\v 5 Emphatically-not, I-am-saying to{you}; contrariwise, if-supposing you-should_not_be-changing-mind/thinking, [you] all similarly will-perish-off/away."
\v 6 Moreover, he-has-been-saying the-same, the parable, "Someone has-been-having [a] fig-tree, having-been-planted in to{the vineyard} of{same}, and he-comes seeking fruit in to{same} and does_not_discover.
\v 7 Moreover, he-says toward the vineyard-worker, 'Behold, I-am-being-come three years seeking fruit in to{the fig-tree, the-same} and I-am_not_discovering. Cut-out same in-which-place what[?] also the land is-being-unemployed/idle/disused.'
\v 8 Moreover, the respond[ing] is-saying to{same}, 'Lord, let-off/away-from same and the year, the-same, until of{when} I-may-excavate around same and may-cast manures,
\v 9 and-supposing, on-one-hand, it-may-make fruit; if, on-the-other-hand, no-indeed into the being-about, you-will-cut-out same.'"
\v 10 Moreover, he-has-been-being teaching in to{one} of{the gatherings[translit. "synagogues"]} in to{the sabbaths}
\v 11 and, behold, [a] woman has-been-being having [a] spirit of{infirmity} ten and eight years, and has-been-being stooping-together and not being-enabled to-stoop-up/anew into the all-complete.
\v 12 Moreover, behold[ing], the Jesus sounds-toward same and says to{same}, "Woman, you-have-been-loosed-off/away-from of{the infirmity} of{you},"
\v 13 and he-upon-places the hands to{same} and immediately she-is-straightened-up and has-been-esteem-izing/glorifying the God.
\v 14 Moreover, respond[ing], the gathering[translit. "synagogue"]-chief, being-irritated that the Jesus heals to{the sabbath}, has-been-saying to{the crowd}, "Six days are-being in to{which} it-is-necessitating to-be-work-izing-self so, in to{the-same} being-come, be-being-healed, and not to{the day} of{the sabbath}."
\v 15 So, the Lord responds to{same} and says, "Pretenders, each of{you} to{the sabbath} is_not_loosing the ox of{same} or the donkey from of{the manger} and, lead[ing]-off/away, is-drink-izing[?]
\v 16 Moreover, the-same being [a] daughter [of-]Abraham, whom the Satan/adversary binds, behold, ten and eight years, it-has_not_been-necessitating to-be-loosed from of{the bond, the-same} to{the day} of{the sabbath}[?],"
\v 17 and, of{same saying} the-same, all the being-lain-opposed to{same} have-been-being-shamed-down and all the crowd has-been-joying upon to{all the in-esteem-ious/glorious, the being-become} under of{same}.
\v 18 Moreover, he-has-been-saying, "To{what[?]} is-being the kingdom of{the God} analogous, and to{what[?]} I-will-liken same[?]
\v 19 It-is-being analogous to{[a] kernel} of{mustard}, which [a] man, take[ing], casts into [the] plantation of{sameself}, and it-grows and becomes into [a] large tree, and the flying-creatures of{the heaven} roost in to{the branches} of{same},"
\v 20 and again he-says, "To{what[?]} I-will-liken the kingdom of{the God}[?]
\v 21 It-is-being analogous to{leaven}, which [a] woman, take[ing], conceals-in into three seahs of{flour}, until of{which} it-is-leavened whole,"
\v 22 and he-has-been-being-gone-through according-to cities and villages, teaching and making/being-made going[noun]/journey into Jerusalem.
\v 23 Moreover, someone says to{same}, "Lord, if few, the being-saved[?]" Moreover, the says toward same,
\v 24 "Be-competing/contending to-come-into through of{the narrow gate}, that many, I-am-saying to{you}, will-seek to-come-into and will_not_have-strength.
\v 25 From of{which} supposing the house-ruler may-be-roused and may-close-off the door, and you-may-initiate outside to-have-stood and to-be-knocking the door, saying, 'Lord, lord, open-up to{us}' and, respond[ing], he-will-say to{you}, 'I-have_not_beheld you. Whence[?] you-are-being[?]'
\v 26 Then you-will-initiate to-be-saying, 'We-eat in-sight of{you} and we-drink and in to{the broad[space]s} of{us} you-teach,'
\v 27 and he-will-say, 'I-am-saying to{you} I-have_not_beheld you. Whence[?] you-are-being[?] Stand-off/away from of{emphatically-me} all the workers of{the injustice}.'
\v 28 There will-be the weeping[noun] and the gnashing[noun] of{the teeth} when-supposing you-may-see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in to{the kingdom} of{the God}; moreover, you being-cast-out outside,
\v 29 and they-will-arrive from of{risings/[east]} and of{settings/[west]} and of{north/northeast} and of{south/southwest} and will-be-reclined in to{the kingdom} of{the God},
\v 30 and, behold, lasts are-being the will-be firsts and firsts are-being the will-be lasts."
\v 31 In to{same, the day}, some Pharisees come-toward, saying to{same}, "Come-out and be-being-gone from-here, that Herod is-will-ing to-kill-off/away you,"
\v 32 and he-says to{same}, "Be[ing]-gone, say to{the fox, the-same}, 'Behold, I-am-casting-out demons and am-completing-upon cure-sis-es[i.e. states of cures] today and the-next-day, and to{the third} I-am-being-accomplished.'
\v 33 More-ly, it-is-necessitating me today and the-next-day and to{the being-had/held} to-be-being-gone, that it-is_not_receiving-in[i.e. acceptable] [a] prophet to-perish-off/away outside [of-]Jerusalem.
\v 34 Jerusalem, the killing-off/away the prophets and stone-casting the having-been-sent-off/away toward same, how-many-times I-will to-gather-upon the offsprings of{you}, which manner [a] hen the brood of{sameself} under the wings, and you-do_not_will.
\v 35 Behold, the desolate house of{you} is-being-let-off/away to{you}. Moreover, I-am-saying to{you} that no, you-would_not_behold me until supposing would-arrive when you-would-say, 'Having-been-good-word-ed, the being-come in to{[the] name} of{[the] Lord},'"
\c 14
\v 1 and it-becomes in to{the} to-come same into of{some} house of{the chiefs} of{the Pharisees} to{sabbath} to-eat bread, and same[plural] have-been-being keeping-beside same,
\v 2 and, behold, some man has-been-being dropsical in-front of{same},
\v 3 and, respond[ing], the Jesus says toward the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "It-is-being-permitted to{the sabbath} to-be-healing or not[?]"
\v 4 Moreover, the[plural] quiet-ize, and, take[ing]-upon, he-cures same and looses-off/away,
\v 5 and, respond[ing] toward same, he-says, "Of{any} son or ox of{you} will-fall-in into [a] cistern/tank/reservoir/well and not straightaway he-will-draw-up same in to{the day} of{the sabbath}[?],"
\v 6 and they-do_not_have-strength to-counter-respond to{same} toward the-same[neuter plural].
\v 7 Moreover, he-has-been-saying [a] parable toward the having-been-called, holding-upon how they-have-been-choosing the first-[re]cline-places, saying toward same,
\v 8 "When-supposing you-may-be-called under of{someone} into weddings, you-should_not_be-laid-down into the first-[re]cline-place, not-whereby more-in-value of{you} may-be-being having-been-called under of{same}
\v 9 and, come[ing], the call[ing] you and same will-say to{you}, 'Give to{the-same} [the] place,' and then you-may-initiate alongside of{shame} to-be-holding-down the last place.
\v 10 Contrariwise, when-supposing you-may-be-called, be[ing]-gone, fall-anew[i.e. sit down] into the last place, in-which-place when-supposing the having-called you may-come, he-may-say to{you}, 'Friend, step-up-toward more-up.' Then it-will-be to{you} esteem/glory in-sight of{the reclining-together} to{you},
\v 11 that every, the elevating sameself, will-be-lowered, and the lowering sameself will-be-elevated."
\v 12 Moreover, he-has-been-saying also to{the having-called} same, "When-supposing you-may-be-making breakfast/lunch or dinner/supper, do_not_be-sounding the friends of{you}, nor the brothers of{you}, nor the[plural] together-begotten[i.e. related] of{you}, nor rich neighbors, not-whereby also same may-opposite-call[i.e. invite in return] you and may-become to{you} opposite-give-off/away-effect[i.e. compensation in exchange].
\v 13 Contrariwise, when-supposing you-may-be-making [a] reception, be-calling destitute, maimed/disabled, lame, blind,
\v 14 and you-will-be blessed, that they-are_not_having to-opposite-give-off/away[i.e. compensation in exchange] to{you}, for it-will-be-opposite-given-off/away[i.e. compensation in exchange] to{you} in to{the stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection]} of{the just}."
\v 15 Moreover, hear[ing], someone of{the being-lain-up/anew-together}, the-same[plural], says to{same}, "Blessed, who will-eat bread in to{the kingdom} of{the God}."
\v 16 Moreover, the says to{same}, "Some man makes [a] large dinner/supper and calls many,
\v 17 and he-sends-off/away the slave of{same} to{the hour} of{the dinner/supper} to-say to{the having-been-called}, "Be-being-come, that already all is-being ready,"
\v 18 and they-initiate from of{one} to-be-being-given-cause-aside[i.e. excused], all. The first says to{same}, 'I-purchase [a] field, and I-am-having compulsion to-come-out and to-behold same. I-am-asking you, be-having me having-been-given-cause-aside[i.e. excused],'
\v 19 and [a] different-other says, 'I-purchase yokes of{oxen}, five, and am-being-gone to-esteem-ize/evaluate same. I-am-asking you, be-having me having-been-given-cause-aside[i.e. excused],'
\v 20 and [a] different-other says, 'I-marry [a] woman, and through the-same I-am_not_being-enabled to-come,'
\v 21 and, become[ing]-aside, the slave, the-there, messages-off/away to{the lord} of{same}, the-same[neuter plural]. Then, angered, the house-ruler says to{the slave} of{same}, 'Come-out speedily into the broad[space]s and streets of{the city} and lead-into here the destitute and maimed/disabled and lame and blind,'
\v 22 and the slave says, 'Lord, it-has-become as you-set-upon and still place is-being,'
\v 23 and the lord says toward the slave, 'Come-out into the ways and barriers and compel to-come-into, in-which-place the house of{me} may-be-fill-ized,'
\v 24 for I-am-saying to{you} that not-one of{the men, the-there-s, the having-been-called,} will-taste of{the dinner/supper} of{me}."
\v 25 Moreover, many crowds have-been-being-gone-together to{same} and, turned, he-says toward same,
\v 26 "If any is-being-come toward me and is_not_hating the father of{sameself} and the mother and the woman and the offsprings and the brothers and the sisters and, moreover still, the life of{sameself}, he-is_not_being-enabled to-be-being [a] disciple of{me},
\v 27 and the-who is_not_bearing[weight] the cross of{same} and is-being-come behind of{me} is_not_being-enabled of{me} to-be-being [a] disciple,

\v 30 saying that the-same, the man, initiates to-be-house-building and does_not_have-strength to-complete-out.
\v 31 Or, who[?], [a] king, being-gone to-together-cast to{[a] different-other king} into war emphatically-not, sit[ing]-down, first is-intending if he-is-being enabled/empowered[adjective] in to{ten thousand} to-encounter to{the} alongside of{twenty thousand} to{being-come} upon same[?]
\v 32 Moreover, if no-indeed, still of{same being} distantly, send[ing]-off/away elder-ia/embassy, he-is-asking the toward peace.
\v 33 So, the-same-ly, every out of{you} who is_not_setting-off/away to{all the[plural] originating-under} of{sameself} is_not_being-enabled to-be-being [a] disciple of{me}.

\v 1 Moreover, all the [tax]collectors and the sinful have-been-being becoming-near to{same} to-be-hearing of{same},
\v 2 and the Pharisees and the scribes have-been-murmuring/muttering/grumbling-through, saying that the-same is-receiving-toward sinful and is-eating-together to{same}.
\v 3 Moreover, he-says toward same the parable, the-same, saying,
\v 4 "Who[?], [a] man out of{you}, having [a] hundred sheep, and lose[ing]-off/away one out of{same}, is_not_leaving-behind the ninety-nine in to{the desolate} and is-being-gone upon the having-been-lost-off/away until he-may-discover same[?],
\v 5 and, discover[ing], he-is-placing-upon upon the shoulders of{sameself} joying,
\v 6 and, come[ing] into the house, he-is-calling-together the friends and the neighbors, saying to{same}, 'Be-joyed-together to{me}, that I-discover the sheep of{me}, the having-been-lost-off/away.'
\v 7 I-am-saying to{you} that the-same-ly it-will-be joy in to{the heaven} upon to{one sinful changing-mind/thinking} than upon to{ninety nine just}, the-who are_not_having need of{change-of-mind/thinking}.
\v 8 Or, who[?], [a] woman having ten drachmas, if-supposing she-may-lose-off/away one drachma, emphatically-not is-kindling [a] lamp and is-sweeping the home and is-seeking upon-concern/carefully until of{when} she-may-discover[?],
\v 9 and, discover[ing], she-is-calling-together the friends and the neighbors, saying, 'Be-joyed-together to{me}, that I-discover the drachma, which I-lose-off/away.'
\v 10 The-same-ly I-am-saying to{you}, it-is-becoming joy in-sight of{the messengers} of{the God} upon to{one sinful changing-mind/thinking}."
\v 11 Moreover, he-says, "Some man has-been-having two sons,
\v 12 and the younger of{same} says to{the father}, "Father, give to{me} the being-cast-upon portion of{the being-ia}," and he-distinguishes/partitions to{same[plural]} the livelihood,
\v 13 and, alongside not many days, gather[ing] emphatically-all, the younger son goes-abroad into [a] far region and there scatters-through the being-ia of{same}, being-alive unsalvageably.
\v 14 Moreover, of{same spend[ing]} all, [a] strong famine becomes down/against the region, the-there, and same initiates to-be-being-deficient-ed,
\v 15 and, be[ing]-gone, he-is-adhered to{one} of{the city-ers/citizens} of{the region, the-there} and he-dispatches same into the fields of{same} to-be-grazing pigs,
\v 16 and he-has-been-desiring-upon to-fill-ize the cavity-ia of{same} from of{the horns[of carob], which} the pigs have-been-eating, and not-one has-been-giving to{same}.
\v 17 Moreover, come[ing] into sameself, he-says, 'How-many hired-s of{the father} of{me} are-exceeding of{breads}; moreover, I am-perishing-off/away to{famine}.
\v 18 Stand[ing]-up/anew I-will-be-gone toward the father of{me} and will-say to{same}, "Father, I-sin into the heaven and in-sight of{you},
\v 19 and I-am-being not-still worthwhile to-be-called [a] son of{you}. Make me as one of{the hired} of{you},"'
\v 20 and, stand[ing]-up/anew, he-comes toward the father of{same}; moreover, still of{same} far of{having-off/away}, the father of{same} beholds same and is-affected-inwardly[i.e. feels compassion] and, hurry[ing], falls-upon upon the neck of{same} and fonds-down/against same.
\v 21 Moreover, the son says to{same}, 'Father, I-sin into the heaven and in-sight of{you}, and I-am-being not-still worthwhile to-be-called [a] son of{you}.'
\v 22 Moreover, the father says toward the slaves of{same}, 'Carry-out the wardrobe, the first, and clothe same, and give [a] ring into the hand of{same} and footwear into the feet,
\v 23 and, carry[ing] the calf, the grain-fed, sacrifice and, eat[ing], we-may-be-gladdened,
\v 24 that the-same, the son of{me}, has-been-being dead and is-alive-anew, and has-been-being having-been-lost-off/away, and is-discovered,' and initiates to-be-being-gladdened.
\v 25 Moreover, the son of{same}, the elder, has-been-being in to{[the] field}, and as he-becomes-near to{the home}, being-come, he-hears of{together-sound-ia/harmony/music} and of{choruses/dances},
\v 26 and, call[ing]-toward-self one of{the children}, he-has-been-ascertaining what supposing might-be-being the-same.
\v 27 Moreover, the says to{same} that 'the brother of{you} has-arrived and the father of{you} sacrifices the calf, the grain-fed, that he-takes-off/away same being-healthy.'
\v 28 Moreover, he-is-angered, and has_not_been-being-will-ing to-come-into. So, the father of{same}, come[ing]-out, has-been-calling-aside same.
\v 29 Moreover, the, respond[ing], says to{the father}, 'Behold, the-which-the-same years I-am-slaving to{you} and not-yet-ever I-pass-by [a] command of{you}, and to{emphatically-me} not-yet-ever you-give [a] [young]goat, in-which-place alongside of{the friends} of{me} would-be-gladdened.
\v 30 Moreover, when the son of{you}, the-same, the eat[ing]-down the livelihood of{you} alongside of{sexual-immoral-ers} comes, you-sacrifice to{same} the calf, the grain-fed.'
\v 31 Moreover, the says to{same}, 'Offspring, you always are-being alongside of{emphatically-me} and all the mine is-being yours.
\v 32 Moreover, to-be-gladdened and to-be-joyed it-has-been-necessitating that the brother of{you}, the-same, has-been-being dead and is-alive-anew, and has-been-being having-been-lost-off/away, also is-discovered.'"
\c 16
\v 1 Moreover, he-has-been-saying also toward the disciples of{same}, "Some man has-been-being rich, who has-been-having [a] house-legislator, and the-same is-through-cast to{same} as scattering-through the[plural] originating-under of{same},
\v 2 and, sound[ing] same, says to{same}, 'What[?], the-same, I-am-hearing about of{you}[?] Give-off/away the word/account of{the house-legislation} of{you}, for you-will_not_enable/be-enabled still to-be-house-legislating.'
\v 3 Moreover, the house-legislator says in to{sameself}, 'What[?] I-may-do, that the lord of{me} is-being-lifted-off/away-from from of{emphatically-me} the house-legislation[?] I-am_not_having-strength to-be-excavating. I-am-being-ashamed to-be-giving-cause/requesting-upon/begging.
\v 4 I-know what I-will-do, in-which-place when-supposing I-may-be-stood-across[i.e. removed from] of{the house-legislation}, they-may-receive me into the houses of{same},'
\v 5 and, call[ing]-toward-self each one of{the obligation-owe-ers} of{the lord} of{sameself}, he-has-been-saying to{the first}, 'How-much[?] you-are-owing to{the lord} of{me}[?]'
\v 6 Moreover, the says, '[A] hundred baths[Hebrew] of{olive-oil},' and he-says to{same}, 'Receive of{you} the write-effect and, sit[ing]-down, speedily write fifty.'
\v 7 Upon-thereafter, to{different-other} he-says, 'Moreover, you, how-much[?] you-are-owing[?]' Moreover, the says, '[A] hundred kors[Hebrew] of{grain},' and he-is-saying to{same}, 'Receive of{you} the write-effect and write eighty,'
\v 8 and the lord praises-upon the house-legislator of{the injustice}, that he-does prudently, that the sons of{the eon, the-same} are-being more-prudent over the sons of{the light} into the generation of{sameselves},
\v 9 and-I am-saying to{you}, make to{sameselves} friends out of{the mammon} of{the injustice}, in-which-place when-supposing it-may-quit-out/exhaust, they-may-receive you into the eternal tents.
\v 10 The faithful in to{least} also is-being faithful in to{much}, and the unjust in to{least} also is-being unjust in to{much}.
\v 11 So, if faithful in to{the unjust mammon} you-do_not_become, who[?] will-entrust the genuine to{you}[?],
\v 12 and if faithful in to{the belonging-to-another} you-do_not_become, who[?] will-give the yours to{you}[?]
\v 13 Not-one domestic/house-resident is-being-enabled to-be-slaving to{two lords}, for either he-will-hate the one and will-love the different-other, or will-hold-against of{one} and will-disregard of{the different-other}. You-are_not_being-enabled to-be-slaving to{God} and to{mammon}."
\v 14 Moreover, the silver-fond Pharisees undertaking the-same all also have-been-hearing, and have-been-nose-izing-out/mocking-out same,
\v 15 and he-says to{same}, "You are-being the justifying sameselves in-sight of{the men}; moreover, the God is-knowing the hearts of{you}, that the high in to{men} is-being [an] abomination in-sight of{the God}.
\v 16 The law and the prophets until of{John}; from then the kingdom of{the God} is-being-good-message-ized, and every into same is-being-forced.
\v 17 Moreover, it-is-being easier, the heaven and the earth to-pass-by, than one point to-fall of{the law}.
\v 18 The every loosing-off/away the woman of{same} and marrying [a] different-other is-adultering, and the every having-been-loosed-off/away from of{[a] man}, marrying, is-adultering.
\v 19 Moreover, some man has-been-being rich and has-been-being-dressed purple and fine-cloth, being-gladdened according-to day [i.e. day by day], shiningly/brilliantly/splendidly.
\v 20 Moreover, some destitute has-been-being, to{name} 'Lazarus,' who had-been-cast toward the gateway of{same}, having-been-wounded/ulcerated,
\v 21 and desiring-upon to-be-fed-ized from of{the crumblets, the falling} from of{the table} of{the rich}, and, contrariwise, the dogs, being-come, have-been-licking-off/away the wounds/sores of{same}.
\v 22 Moreover, it-becomes to-die-off/away, the destitute, and to-be-carried-off/away same under of{the messengers} into the bosom/lap of{the} Abraham. Moreover, also the rich dies-off/away and is-buried,
\v 23 and in to{the unseen/Hades}, lift[ing]-upon the eyes of{same}, originating-under in to{torments}, he-is-seeing the Abraham from afar and Lazarus in to{the bosoms/laps} of{same},
\v 24 and same, sound[ing], says, 'Father Abraham, show-mercy-to me and dispatch Lazarus, in-which-place he-may-dip the extremity of{the finger} of{same} of{water} and may-cool-down the tongue of{me}, that I-am-distressing in to{the flame, the-same}.'
\v 25 Moreover, Abraham says, 'Offspring, remember that you take-off/away the beneficial of{you} in to{the being-alive[noun]} of{you} and Lazarus similarly the bad. Moreover, now thus he-is-being-called-aside; moreover, you are-distressing,
\v 26 and upon to{all, the-same}, between of{us} and of{you} [a] large chasm has-been-established, which-how the will-ing to-step-through from-here toward you may_not_be-being-enabled, nor the from-there toward us they-may-be-going-through-to-other-side.'
\v 27 Moreover, he-says, 'So, I-am-asking you, father, in-which-place you-may-dispatch same into the house of{the father} of{me},
\v 28 for I-am-having five brothers, which-how he-may-be-witnessing/be-witnessed-through to{same}, in-which-place not also same would-come into the place, the-same, of{the torment}.'
\v 29 Abraham is-saying to{same}, 'They-are-having Moses and the prophets. [They:] hear of{same}.'
\v 30 Moreover, the says, 'Emphatically-not, father Abraham; contrariwise, if-supposing someone from of{dead} may-be-gone toward same they-will-change-mind/thinking.'
\v 31 Moreover, he-says to{same}, 'If they-are_not_hearing of{Moses} and of{the prophets}, neither if-supposing someone out of{dead} may-stand-up/anew they-will-be-persuaded.'"
\c 17
\v 1 Moreover, he-says toward the disciples, "It-is-being un-received-in/inadmissible of{the} to_not_come the scandals; moreover, woe through of{whom} it-is-being-come.
\v 2 It-is-being-appropriate to{same} if [a] donkey[adjective] millstone is-being-lain-around around the neck of{same} and has-been-tossed into the seawater than in-which-place he-may-scandalize one of{the little, the-same}.
\v 3 Be-holding-toward to{sameselves}. Moreover, if-supposing the brother of{you} may-sin into you, adjudge-valuation-upon to{same}, and if-supposing he-may-change-mind/thinking, let-off/away to{same},
\v 4 and if-supposing seven-ly of{the day} he-may-sin into you and seven-ly of{the day} he-may-upon-turn toward you, saying, 'I-am-changing-mind/thinking,' you-will-let-off/away to{same},"
\v 5 and the sent-off[one]s say to{the Lord}, "Place-toward to{us} faith."
\v 6 Moreover, the Lord says, "If you-have-been-having faith as [a] kernel of{mustard}, you-have-been-saying supposing to{the mulberry-tree, the-same}, 'Be-rooted-out and be-planted in to{the seawater},' and it-hearkens-under supposing to{you}.
\v 7 Moreover, who[?] out of{you}, having [a] slave plowing or shepherding who, to{come[ing]-into} out of{the field} will-say, straightaway, 'Come[ing]-aside, fall-anew[i.e. sit down]'[?]
\v 8 Contrariwise, emphatically-not. He-will-say to{same}, 'Prepare what I-may-dine/sup and, be[ing]-girded-around, be-serving to{me} until I-may-eat and may-drink and, alongside the-same, you will-eat and will-drink.'
\v 9 He-is-having no grace/favor to{the slave, the-there}, that he-does the set-through to{same}. I-am_not_esteeming.
\v 10 The-same-ly, also, you, when-supposing you-may-do all the set-through to{you}, be-saying that 'we-are-being needless slaves, that, which we-have-been-owing to-do, we-have-done,'"
\v 11 and it-becomes in to{the} to-be-being-gone same into Jerusalem and same has-been-being-come-through through of{midst} of{Samaria} and of{Galilee},
\v 12 and, of{same being-come-into} into some village, ten leprous men meet-off/away to{same}, who stand from-distantly,
\v 13 and same lift [a] sound, saying, "Jesus, superintendent, show-mercy-to us,"
\v 14 and, behold[ing], he-says to{same}, "Be[ing]-gone, show-upon sameselves to{the consecrateds[i.e. priests]}," and it-becomes, in to{the} to-be-withdrawing, same, they-are-purged/cleansed.
\v 15 Moreover, one out of{same}, behold[ing] that he-is-cured, returns alongside of{large sound}, esteem-izing/glorifying the God,
\v 16 and he-falls upon [his] face beside the feet of{same}, well-favoring/giving-thanks to{same}, and same has-been-being [a] Samaritan.
\v 17 Moreover, respond[ing], the Jesus says, "Emphatically-not[?] the ten are-purged/cleansed[?] Moreover, the nine, where[?]
\v 18 They-are_not_found return[ing] to-give esteem/glory to{the God} if not the other-become[noun][i.e. other race], the-same[?],"
\v 19 and he-says to{same}, "Stand[ing]-up/anew, be-being-gone. The faith of{you} has-saved you."
\v 20 Moreover, be[ing]-asked-upon under of{the Pharisees} at-what-time the kingdom of{the God} is-being-come, he-responds to{same} and says, "The kingdom of{the God} is_not_being-come alongside of{kept-aside-sis/surveillance},
\v 21 nor they-will-say, 'Behold here,' or, 'Behold there,' for behold, the kingdom of{the God} is-being within of{you}."
\v 22 Moreover, he-says toward the disciples, "Days will-be-come when you-will-desire-upon to-behold one of{the days} of{the son} of{the man}, and you-will_not_see,
\v 23 and they-will-say to{you}, 'Behold here,' or, 'Behold there.' You-should_not_come-off/away nor should-chase,
\v 24 for even-as the lightning lightning-ing[verb] out of{the} under heaven into the under heaven is-shining, the-same-ly will-be the son of{the man} in to{the day} of{same}.
\v 25 Moreover, first it-is-necessitating same to-suffer many and to-be-esteem-ized-off/away[i.e. be rejected] from of{the generation, the-same},
\v 26 and according-as it-becomes in to{the days} of{the Noah}, the-same-ly it-will-be also in to{the days} of{the son} of{the man}.
\v 27 They-have-been-eating, they-have-been-drinking, they-have-been-marrying, they-have-been-being-marry-ized-out[i.e. given out/away in marriage], even-to of{which day} Noah comes-into into the ark, and the deluge comes and destroys-off/away emphatically-all.
\v 28 Similarly also as it-becomes in to{the days} [of-]Lot, they-have-been-eating, they-have-been-drinking, they-have-been-purchasing, they-have-been-selling, they-have-been-planting, they-have-been-house-building;
\v 29 moreover, to{which day} Lot comes-out from of{Sodoms}, it-wets fire and brimstone/sulfur from of{heaven} and destroys-off/away emphatically-all.
\v 30 According-to the-same it-will-be to{which day} the son of{the man} is-being-off-covered/uncovered.
\v 31 In to{the-there, the day,} who will-be upon of{the building}, and the vessels of{same} in to{the home}: do_not_descend to-lift same; also, the in to{the field} similarly: do_not_turn-upon into the behind.
\v 32 You-are-remembering of{the woman} [of-]Lot.
\v 33 Who if-supposing may-seek to-save the life of{same} will-destroy-off/away same, and who if-supposing may-destroy-off/away same will-become-alive same.
\v 34 I-am-saying to{you}, to{the-same, the night} [there]will-be two upon of{one bed}; one will-be-taken-aside and the different-other will-be-let-off/away.
\v 35 Two will-be grinding upon the same; one will-be-taken-aside and the different-other will-be-let-off/away,"
\v 37 and, respond[ing], they-are-saying to{same}, "Where[?], Lord[?]" Moreover, the says to{same}, "Which-where the body, there the eagles will-be-gathered."
\c 18
\v 1 Moreover, he-has-been-saying also [a] parable to{same}, toward the to-be-necessitating always same to-be-praying and not to-be-bad-ing-out,
\v 2 saying, "Some judge has-been-being in to{some city}, not fearing the God and not being-introspected-about man.
\v 3 Moreover, [a] widow has-been-being in to{the city, the-there} and has-been-being-come toward same, saying, 'Give-out-justice-to/vindicate me from of{the litigant} of{me},'
\v 4 and he-does_not_will, upon [a] time. Moreover, alongside the-same he-says in to{sameself}, 'If also I-am_not_fearing the God and I-am_not_being-introspected-about man,
\v 5 yet through the to-be-having-aside/presenting to{me} toil, the widow, the-same, I-will-give-out-justice-to/vindicate same, lest in-which-place into finish, being-come, she-may-be-provoking me.'"
\v 6 Moreover, the Lord says, "Hear what the judge of{the injustice} is-saying.
\v 7 Moreover, the God, no, will_not_do the out-justice/vindication of{the[plural] chosen of{same[singular]}, the[plural] crying} toward same[singular] of{day} and of{night} and being-far-[furious]desire[i.e. longsuffering] upon to{same[plural]}[?]
\v 8 I-am-saying to{you} that he-will-do the out-justice/vindication of{same} in to{speed}. More-ly, the son of{the man}, come[ing], consequently will-discover the faith upon of{the earth}."
\v 9 Moreover, he-says the parable, the-same, also toward some, the having-had-confidence upon to{sameselves}, that they-are-being just and nothing-ing-out/discounting the remaining.
\v 10 "Two men ascend into the consecrated[i.e. temple] to-pray, the one [a] Pharisee and the different-other [a] [tax]collector.
\v 11 The Pharisee, be[ing]-stood, has-been-praying the-same toward sameself, 'The God, I-am-well-favoring/giving-thanks to{you}, that I-am_not_being even-as the remaining of{the men}, snatching[adjective], unjust, adulterers, or also as the-same, the [tax]collector.
\v 12 I-am-fasting twice of{the sabbath}. I-am-tenth-ing/off-away all, as-much-as I-am-acquiring,'
\v 13 and the [tax]collector, having-stood afar, has_not_been-will-ing, not-moreover, to-lift-upon the eyes into the heaven; contrariwise, he-has-been-beating the chest/sternum of{same}, saying, 'The God, be-propitiated to{me, the sinful}.'
\v 14 I-am-saying to{you}, the-same descends having-been-justified into the house of{same}, for the-there may-be-being that the every elevating sameself will-be-lowered; moreover, the lowering sameself will-be-elevated."
\v 15 Moreover, they-have-been-carrying-toward to{same} also the babies, in-which-place he-may-be-taking-hold of{same}. Moreover, behold[ing], the disciples adjudge-valuation-upon to{same}.
\v 16 Moreover, the Jesus, call[ing]-toward-self same, says, "Let-off/away the childlings to-be-being-come toward me and do_not_be-hindering same, for of{the to-which-the-same} is-being the kingdom of{the God}.
\v 17 Amen I-am-saying to{you}, who if-supposing would_not_receive the kingdom of{the God} as [a] childling, no, would_not_come-into into same,"
\v 18 and some chief asks-upon same, saying, "Beneficial teacher, what[?], do[ing], will-inherit eternal being-alive[noun][?]"
\v 19 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "What[?] you-are-saying me beneficial[?] Not-one beneficial if not one, the God.
\v 20 You-have-beheld the commands. You-should_not_adulter, you-should_not_murder, you-should_not_steal, you-should_not_false-witness, be-valuing the father of{you} and the mother of{you}."
\v 21 Moreover, the says, "the-same all I-guard-such-as-to-be-guarded out of{youth} of{me}."
\v 22 Moreover, hear[ing] the-same, the Jesus says to{same}, "Still one to{you} is-quitting/forsaking/abandoning. Sell all, as-much-as you-are-having, and give-through/distribute to{destitute} and you-will-have wealth in to{heaven}, and Come! Be-accompanying to{me}."
\v 23 Moreover, the, hear[ing] the-same, about-grief becomes, for he-has-been-being rich vehemently.
\v 24 Moreover, the Jesus behold[ing] same become[ing] about-grief says, "How[?] difficultly the having the business-effects will-be-come-into into the kingdom of{the God}[?],
\v 25 for it-is-being easier, [a] camel through of{needle hole} to-come-into, than rich into the kingdom of{the God} to-come-into."
\v 26 Moreover, the hear[ing] say, "And who[?] is-being-enabled to-be-saved[?]"
\v 27 Moreover, the says, "The unenabled[adjective] beside to{men} is-being enabled[adjective] beside to{the God}."
\v 28 Moreover, the Peter says, "Behold, we let-off/away all and accompany to{you}."
\v 29 Moreover, the says to{same[plural]}, "Amen I-am-saying to{you} that not-one is-being who lets-off/away home or parents or brothers or woman or offsprings because of{the kingdom} of{the God}
\v 30 who no, would_not_take-off/away multiple in to{the season, the-same}, and in to{the eon, the being-come}, eternal being-alive[noun]."
\v 31 Moreover, take[ing]-aside the twelve, he-says toward same, "Behold, we-are-ascending into Jerusalem, and all the having-been-written through of{the prophets} will-be-completed to{the son} of{the man},
\v 32 for he-will-be-given-aside/delivered to{the nations} and will-be-infantilized and will-be-rampaged and will-be-spit-in
\v 33 and, scourge[ing], they-will-kill-off/away same and to{the day, the third,} he-will-stand/be-stood-up/anew,"
\v 34 and the-same put-together not-one of{the-same}, and the say-effect/statement, the-same, has-been-being having-been-hidden from of{same}, and they-have_not_been-knowing the saying[verb participle].
\v 35 Moreover, it-becomes in to{the} to-be-becoming-near same into Jericho some blind has-been-being-seated beside the way giving-cause/requesting-toward.
\v 36 Moreover, hear[ing] of{[the] crowd being-gone-through}, he-has-been-ascertaining what might-be-being the-same.
\v 37 Moreover, they-message-off to{same} that Jesus, the Nazarene, is-being-come-aside,
\v 38 and he-cries, saying, "Jesus, son [of-]David, show-mercy-to me,"
\v 39 and the leading-ahead have-been-adjudging-valuation-upon to{same} in-which-place he-should-be-silent; moreover, same has-been-crying-out to{much} more, "Son [of-]David, show-mercy-to me."
\v 40 Moreover, being[ing]-stood, the Jesus orders same to-be-led toward same. Moreover, of{become[ing]-near same}, he-asks-upon same,
\v 41 saying, "What[?] to{you} you-are-will-ing I-may-do[?]" Moreover, the says, "Lord, in-which-place I-may-view-anew,"
\v 42 and the Jesus says to{same}, "View-anew. The faith of{you} has-saved you,"
\v 43 and immediately he-views-anew and has-been-accompanying to{same}, esteem-izing/glorifying the God, and all the people behold[ing] give praise to{the God},
\c 19
\v 1 and, come[ing]-into, he-has-been-being-come-through the Jericho,
\v 2 and, behold, [a] man to{name} being-called "Zaccheus," and same has-been-being chief-[tax]collector, and the-same has-been-being rich,
\v 3 and he-has-been-seeking to-behold the Jesus, who is-being, and he-has_not_been-being-enabled from of{the crowd}, that he-has-been-being small to{the stature},
\v 4 and, hurry[ing]-ahead in-front, he-ascends upon [a] sycamore-tree in-which-place he-may-behold same, that through of{the-there} he-has-been-being-about to-be-being-come-through,
\v 5 and as he-comes upon the place, view[ing]-up, the Jesus beholds same and says toward same, "Zaccheus, hasten[ing], descend, for today it-is-necessitating me to-stay in to{the house} of{you},"
\v 6 and, hasten[ing], he-descends and under-receives same, joying,
\v 7 and, behold[ing], all have-been-murmuring/muttering/grumbling-through, saying that beside to{[a] sinful man} he-comes-into to-loose-down[i.e. retire].
\v 8 Moreover, being[ing]-stood, Zaccheus says toward the Lord, "Behold, Lord, I-am-giving the halves of{the[plural] originating-under} of{me} to{the destitute} and if of{any} what I-fig-reveal/be-informer/blackmail/extort I-am-giving-off/away quadruple."
\v 9 Moreover, the Jesus says toward same that "today salvation becomes to{the house, the-same}, according-that also same is-being son [of-]Abraham,
\v 10 for the son of{the man} comes to-seek and to-save the having-been-lost-off/away."
\v 11 Moreover, of{same[plural] hearing}, place[ing]-toward the-same[neuter plural], he-says [a] parable through the same to-be-being near Jerusalem and same[plural] to-be-esteeming that immediately the kingdom of{the God} is-being-about to-be-being-revealed-anew.
\v 12 So, he-says, "Some well-become[adjective] man is-gone into [a] far region to-take to{sameself} [a] kingdom and to-return.
\v 13 Moreover, call[ing] ten slaves of{sameself}, he-gives to{same} ten minas and says toward same, "Do-practice-effect until I-am-being-come."
\v 14 Moreover, the city-ers/citizens of{same} have-been-hating same and send-off/away [an] elder-ia/embassy behind of{same}, saying, "We-are_not_will-ing the-same to-reign upon us,"
\v 15 and it-becomes in to{the} to-come-upon-anew[i.e. come back again] same, take[ing] the kingdom, also he-says to-be-sounded to{same}, the slaves, the-same, to{whom} he-gives the silver-piece, in-which-place he-may-know who does-practice-effect-through what.
\v 16 Moreover, the first becomes-aside, saying, "Lord, the mina of{you} work-izes-self-toward ten minas,"
\v 17 and he-says to{same}, "Well beneficial, slave, that in to{least} you-become faithful. Be-being having authority up-upon of{ten cities},"
\v 18 and the second comes, saying, "Lord, the mina of{you} makes five minas."
\v 19 Moreover, he-says also to{the-same}, "Also you, be-being-become up-upon of{five cities},"
\v 20 and [a] different-other comes, saying, "Lord, behold, the mina of{you} which I-have-been-having, being-lain-off/away in to{[a] sudarium[Latin]/towel/napkin/cloth},
\v 21 for I-have-been-fearing you, that you-are-being [an] austere man. You-are-lifting the you-do_not_place and you-are-harvesting the you-do_not_sow."
\v 22 Moreover, he-is-saying to{same}, "Out of{the mouth} of{you} I-will-judge you, evil slave. You-had-beheld that I am-being [an] austere man, lifting the I-do_not_place and harvesting the I-do_not_sow,
\v 23 and through what[?] you-do_not_give the silver-piece of{me} upon [the] [money market]table, and I, come[ing], supposing I-effect same together-with to{interest}[?],"
\v 24 and to{the having-stood-beside} he-says, "Lift off/away-from of{same} the mina and give to{the having} the ten minas,"
\v 25 and they-say to{same}, "Lord, he-is-having ten minas,"
\v 26 for I-am-saying to{you} that to{every, the having} it-will-be-given; moreover, off/away-from of{the not having} also what he-is-having will-be-lifted off/away-from of{same}.
\v 27 "More-ly, the hostile of{me}, the-there-s, the not will[ing] me to-reign upon same, lead here and slay-down in-front of{me},"
\v 28 and, say[ing] the-same, he-has-been-being-gone in-front, ascending into Jerusalem,
\v 29 and it-becomes as he-becomes-near into Bethphage and Bethany toward the mountain, the being-called "of{olives}," he-sends-off/away two of{the disciples} of{same},
\v 30 say[ing], "Be-withdrawing into the down-in-in-place-of[/opposite/in-front-of] village in to{which}, being-gone-into, you-will-discover [a] colt having-been-bound, upon which not-one ever-yet of{men} sits-down. Loose[ing] same, lead,
\v 31 and if-supposing any may-be-asking you, 'Through what[?] you-are-loosing the-same-ly,' you-will-say to{same} that the Lord is-having need of{same}."
\v 32 Moreover, come[ing]-off/away, the having-been-sent-off/away discover according-as he-says to{same}.
\v 33 Moreover, of{same loosing} the colt, the lords of{same} say toward same, "What[?] you-are-loosing the colt[?]"
\v 34 Moreover, the[plural] say, "The Lord is-having need of{same},"
\v 35 and they-lead same toward the Jesus and, toss[ing]-upon the outer-garments of{sameselves} upon the colt, they-step-ize-upon/mount the Jesus.
\v 36 Moreover, of{same being-gone}, they-have-been-spreading-under, the outer-garments of{same}, in to{the way}.
\v 37 Moreover, of{same becoming-near} already toward to{the descent-sis[i.e. state of descent]} of{the mountain} of{the olives}, they-initiate, emphatically-all, the multitude of{the disciples}, joying to-be-praising the God to{large sound} around of{all who} behold of{[the] enablements/empowerments},
\v 38 saying, "Having-been-good-word-ed, the being-come king in to{[the] name} of{[the] Lord}, peace in to{heaven} and esteem/glory in to{highest},"
\v 39 and some of{the Pharisees} from of{the crowd} say toward same, "Teacher, adjudge-valuation-upon to{the disciples} of{you},"
\v 40 and, respond[ing], he-says to{same}, "I-am-saying to{you} that if-supposing the-same may-be-silent the stones will-cry-out,"
\v 41 and as he-becomes-near, behold[ing] the city, he-weeps upon to{same},
\v 42 saying that "if you-know, and/also you and/also yet in to{the day} of{you}, to{the-same}, the toward peace of{you}; moreover, now it-is-hidden from of{[the] eyes} of{you},
\v 43 that days will-arrive upon you, and the hostile of{you} will-cast-around [a] palisade[barricade of pales/poles/stakes/fortification] to{you} and will-circle-around you and will-together-hold you from-everywhere,
\v 44 and will-ground/level-ize you and the offsprings of{you} in to{you}, and they-will_not_let-off/away in to{you} stone upon to{stone}, instead/contrary/against of{whom} you-do_not_know the season of{the watch-upon/oversight} of{you},"
\v 45 and, come[ing]-into into the consecrated[i.e. temple], he-initiates to-be-casting-out the selling in to{same} and purchasing,
\v 46 saying to{same}, "It-has-been-written, 'The house of{me} is-being [a] house of{prayer};' moreover, you make same [a] cave of{robbers},"
\v 47 and he-has-been-being teaching the according-to day [i.e. day by day] in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}; moreover, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the scribes, also the firsts of{the people}, have-been-seeking to-destroy-off/away same,
\v 48 and they-have_not_been-discovering the what they-may-do, for the people, emphatically-every, has-been-hanging-out, hearing of{same},
\c 20
\v 1 and it-becomes in to{one} of{the days, the-there-s,} of{same teaching} the people in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} and of{good-message-izing}, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the scribes together-with to{the elders} stand-upon,
\v 2 and they-say, saying toward same, "Say to{us} in to{about-what-such[?] authority} you-are-doing the-same, or who[?] is-being the give[ing] to{you} the authority, the-same[?]"
\v 3 Moreover, respond[ing], he-says toward same, "Also-I will-ask you one word, and, say to{me}.
\v 4 The immerse-effect of{John} has-been-being out of{heaven} or out of{men}[?]"
\v 5 Moreover, the[plural] dialog-ize-together toward sameselves, saying that "if-supposing we-may-say, 'Out of{heaven},' he-will-say, 'So, through what[?] you-do_not_entrust to{same}[?]'
\v 6 Moreover, if-supposing we-may-say, 'Out of{men},' all the people will-stone-ize-down us, for it-is-being having-been-persuaded John[accusative], [a] prophet[accusative], to-be-being,"
\v 7 and they-respond to-have_not_beheld whence,
\v 8 and the Jesus says to{same}, "Neither I am-saying to{you} in to{about-what-such authority} I-am-doing the-same."
\v 9 Moreover, he-initiates to-be-saying toward the people the parable, the-same, "Some man plants [a] vineyard and gives-out same to{land-workers} and goes-abroad sufficient times,
\v 10 and in to{season} he-sends-off/away toward the land-workers [a] slave, in-which-place they-may-give from of{the fruit} of{the vineyard} to{same}. Moreover, the land-workers, flay[ing] same, send-out-off/away empty,
\v 11 and he-places-self-toward to-dispatch [a] different-other slave. Moreover, the[plural] flay[ing] also-the-there and, un-value-ize[ing], send-out-off/away empty,
\v 12 and he-places-self-toward to-dispatch [a] third. Moreover, the[plural] also, wound-effect-ize[ing] the-same, cast-out.
\v 13 Moreover, the lord of{the vineyard} says, "What[?] I-may-do[?] I-will-dispatch the son of{me}, the beloved. Behold[ing] the-same, they-will-be-introspected-about equally."
\v 14 Moreover, behold[ing] same, the land-workers have-been-dialog-izing toward sameselves, saying, 'The-same is-being the inheritor. Come!, we-may-be-killing-off/away same, in-which-place the inheritance may-become of{us},'
\v 15 and, cast[ing]-out same outside of{the vineyard}, they-kill-off/away. So, what[?] the lord of{the vineyard} will-do to{same}[?]
\v 16 He-will-be-come and will-destroy-off/away the land-workers, the-same, and will-give the vineyard to{others}." Moreover, hear[ing], they-say, "It-could_not_become."
\v 17 Moreover, the, view[ing]-in to{same}, says, "So, what[?] is-being the having-been-written, the-same, '[The] stone whom the house-building esteem-ize-off/away[i.e. reject], the-same is-become into head of{corner}.'
\v 18 Every, the fall[ing] upon the-there, the stone, will-be-crushed-together; moreover, upon whom supposing it/he-may-fall it/he-will-winnow same,"
\v 19 and the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the scribes seek to-cast-upon upon same the hands in to{same, the hour} and they-fear the people, for they-know that toward same he-says the parable, the-same,
\v 20 and, keep[ing]-beside, they-send-off/away spies, pretending sameselves to-be-being just, in-which-place they-may-take-upon of{same} of{word} into the to-give-aside/deliver same to{the origin} and to{the authority} of{the governor},
\v 21 and they-ask-upon same, saying, "Teacher, we-have-beheld that straight-up-ly you-are-saying and you-are-teaching and you-are_not_taking face[i.e. appearance]; contrariwise, upon of{truth} you-are-teaching the way of{the God}.
\v 22 It-is-being-permitted to{us} to-give tribute to{Caesar} or not[?]"
\v 23 Moreover, think[ing]-according-to/consider[ing] of{same} the all-working-ia/craftiness, he-says toward same, "What[?] you-are-trial-izing me[?]
\v 24 Show-upon to{me} [a] denarius. Of{whom[?]} it-is-having image and writing-upon/inscription[?]" Moreover, respond[ing], they-say, "Of{Caesar}."
\v 25 Moreover, the says to{same}, "To-this-now/therefore, give-off/away the of{Caesar} to{Caesar} and the of{the God} to{the God},"
\v 26 and they-do_not_have-strength to-take-upon of{same} of{say-effect/statement} in-in-place-of[/opposite/facing] of{the people} and, marvel[ing] upon to{the response} of{same}, refrain-from-speaking.
\v 27 Moreover, some of{the Sadducees} come[ing]-toward, the saying-in-place-of/in-opposition-to/contradicting/rebutting, stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection] not to-be-being, ask-upon same,
\v 28 saying, "Teacher, Moses writes to{us}, if-supposing of{some} brother may-die-off/away having [a] woman, and the-same may-die-off/away without-offspring, in-which-place the brother of{same} would-take the woman and may-stand-up/anew-out sow-effect to{the brother} of{same}.
\v 29 So, they-have-been-being seven brothers, and the first, take[ing] [the] woman, dies-off/away without-offspring,
\v 30 and the second takes the woman, and the-same without-offspring dies-off/away,
\v 31 and the third takes same. Moreover, as-same-ly, also the seven do_not_leave-behind offsprings, and die-off/away.
\v 32 Afterward of{all}, the woman also dies-off/away.
\v 33 So, in to{the stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection]}, of{whom[?]} of{same} is-becoming [the] woman, for the seven have same woman[?],"
\v 34 and, respond[ing], the Jesus says to{same}, "The sons of{the eon, the-same} are-marrying and are-being-marry-ized-out[i.e. given out/away in marriage].
\v 35 Moreover, the considered-worthwhile-according-to of{the eon, the-there} to-occur also of{the stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection]} of{the} out of{dead} neither are-marrying nor are-being-marry-ized-out[i.e. given out/away in marriage],
\v 36 for neither they-are-being-enabled still to-die-off/away, for they-are-being equal-messengers and they-are-being sons of{the God}, being sons of{the stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection]}.
\v 37 Moreover, that the dead are-being-roused, also Moses discloses upon of{the bramble/briar-bush} as he-is-saying 'Lord the God [of-]Abraham and the God [of-]Isaac and the God [of-]Jacob.'
\v 38 Moreover, God is_not_being of{dead}; contrariwise, of{being-alive}, for all are-being-alive to{same}."
\v 39 Moreover, respond[ing], some of{the scribes} say, "Teacher, you-say well."
\v 40 Moreover, they-have_not-still_been-daring to-be-asking-upon same, nothing.
\v 41 Moreover, he-says toward same, "How[?] they-are-saying the Anointed son [of-]David to-be-being[?]
\v 42 and same David is-saying in to{scroll} of{psalms}, 'The Lord says to{the lord} of{me}, "Be-being-seated out of{right} of{me}
\v 43 until supposing I-may-place the hostile of{you} under-foot of{the feet} of{you}."'
\v 44 So, David is-calling same 'lord,' and how[?] he-is-being son of{same}[?]"
\v 45 Moreover, of{all the people hearing}, he-says to{the disciples} of{same},
\v 46 "Be-holding-toward off/away-from of{the scribes, the will-ing} to-be-walking-around in to{wardrobes} and of{liking} greetings in to{the marketplaces} and first-seats in to{the gatherings[translit. 'synagogues']} and first-[re]cline-places in to{the dinners/suppers},
\v 47 the are-eating-down the homes of{the widows} and to{reveal-before-sis[i.e. pretext]} they-are-praying long. The-same will-take/get more-excessive judge-effect/judgment."
\c 21
\v 1 Moreover, view[ing]-up, he-beholds the rich casting the gifts of{same} into the treasury.
\v 2 Moreover, he-beholds also some poor widow casting two mites there,
\v 3 and he-says, "Truly, I-am-saying to{you} that the widow, the destitute, same casts much-more of{all},
\v 4 for emphatically-all, the-same[plural], out of{the exceeding} to{same} cast into the gifts of{the God}; moreover, same[feminine] out of{the deficient/lack-effect} of{same} casts emphatically-all the livelihood which she-has-been-having,"
\v 5 and of{some saying} about of{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, that to{good stones} and to{place-up-effects/monuments/ornaments/offerings} it-has-been-arranged/ordered, he-says,
\v 6 "You-are-observing the-same, which, days will-be-come in to{which} it-will_not_be-let-off/away-from stone upon to{stone} which will_not_be-loosed-down."
\v 7 Moreover, they-ask-upon same, saying, "Teacher, so, at-what-time[?], the-same[plural], it-will-be, and what[?] the sign when-supposing may-be-being-about, the-same[plural], to-be-becoming[?]"
\v 8 Moreover, the says, "Be-viewing, you-would_not_be-led-astray, for many will-be-come upon to{the name} of{me}, saying that 'I am-being' and, 'The season has-become-near,' so, you-should_not_be-gone behind of{same[plural]}.
\v 9 Moreover, when-supposing you-may-hear wars and without-stand-down/against-ias/instabilities you-should_not_be-distraught/upset/dismayed/agitated, for it-is-necessitating the-same[plural] to-become first; contrariwise, not straightaway the completion."
\v 10 Then he-has-been-saying to{same}, "Nation upon nation will-be-roused, and kingdom upon kingdom.
\v 11 Both large/great tempests/shakes/quakes down/against places and famines and plagues will-be. It-will-be both fears/terrors and large/great signs from of{heaven}.
\v 12 Moreover, before of{the-same all} they-will-cast-upon upon you the hands of{same} and will-chase, giving-aside/delivering into gatherings[translit. 'synagogues'] and custodies, being-led upon kings and governors because of{the name} of{me}.
\v 13 Moreover, it-will-step-off/away-from/turn-out/result to{you} into witness.
\v 14 So, place into the hearts of{you} not to-be-being-concerned/care-about-beforehand to-be-defended,
\v 15 for I will-give to{you} mouth and wisdom to{which} all the being-lain-opposed to{you} will_not_enable/be-enabled to-say-in-place-of/against/in-opposition-to/contradict/rebut nor to-stand-in-place-of/against/in-opposition-to/withstand.
\v 16 Moreover, you-will-be-given-aside/delivered also under of{parents} and of{brothers} and of{together-begotten[i.e. related]} and of{friends} and they-will-put-to-death out of{you},
\v 17 and you-will-be being-hated under of{all} through the name of{me},
\v 18 and [a] hair out of{the head} of{you[plural]}, no, would_not_perish-off/away.
\v 19 In to{the remain-under-ance/perseverance} of{you[plural]}, acquire the lives of{you[plural]}.
\v 20 Moreover, when-supposing you-may-behold the Jerusalem being-circled under of{soldier/army-grounds/military-encampments}, then know that the desolate-sis[i.e. state of being desolate] of{same} has-become-near.
\v 21 Then the in to{the Judea}: be-fleeing into the mountains, and the in to{midst} of{same}: be-separating-out, and the in to{the spaces}: do_not_be-being-come-into into same,
\v 22 that the-same are-being days of{out-justice/vindication} of{the} to-be-fulfilled all the having-been-written.
\v 23 Moreover, woe to{the having} in to{belly} and to{the nursing} in to{the-there-s, the days}, for it-will-be large compulsion upon of{the earth} and wrath to{the people, the-same},
\v 24 and they-will-be-fallen to{[the] mouth/edge} of{[the] knife} and will-be-spear-taken-ized/taken-captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will-be being-treaded under of{nations} even-to [the] seasons of{nations} may-be-fulfilled,
\v 25 and it-will-be signs in to{[the] sun} and to{[the] moon} and to{[the] stars} and upon of{the earth}, hold-together[noun] of{nations} in to{difficulty-of-passage/perplexity} of{audible-manifestation} of{seawater} and of{tossing-motion},

\v 27 and then they-will-see the son of{the man} being-come in to{cloud} alongside of{enablement/empowerment} and of{much esteem/glory}.
\v 28 Moreover, of{the-same being-initiated} to-be-being-become, stoop-up/anew and lift-upon the heads of{you}, through-that the loose-off/away-sis[i.e. state of being loosed off/away]/release-off/away of{you} is-becoming-near,"
\v 29 and he-says [a] parable to{same}, "Behold the fig-tree and all the trees.
\v 30 When-supposing they-may-cast-forth, already viewing from of{sameselves} you-are-knowing that already near the summer is-being.
\v 31 The-same-ly also you, when-supposing you-may-behold the-same being-become, be-knowing that near is-being the kingdom of{the God}.
\v 32 Amen I-am-saying to{you} that no, the generation, the-same, should_not_pass-by until supposing all may-become.
\v 33 The heaven and the earth will-be-passed-by; moreover, the words of{me} no, should_not_pass-by.
\v 34 Moreover, be-holding-toward to{sameselves}, not-whereby the hearts of{you} may-be-weighted in to{intoxication} and to{drunkenness} and to{livelihood-ish worries} and sudden/unexpected, the day, the-there, may-stand-upon upon you,
\v 35 for as [a] trap it-will-be-come-upon upon all the being-seated upon [the] face of{all the earth}.
\v 36 So, be-field-sleeping[i.e. ready] in to{all season}, being-necessitated, in-which-place you-may-be-considered-worthwhile-according-to to-flee-out/escape the-same all, the being-about to-be-being-become, and to-be-stood in-front of{the son} of{the man}."
\v 37 Moreover, the days, in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} he-has-been-being teaching; moreover, the nights, being-come-out, he-has-been-being-camped-out/spending-the-night into the mountain, the being-called "of{olives},"
\v 38 and all the people has-been-daybreak-izing toward same in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} to-be-hearing of{same}.
\c 22
\v 1 Moreover, the festival of{the unleavened}, the being-said "passover," has-been-becoming-near,
\v 2 and the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the scribes have-been-seeking the how they-may-lift-up[i.e. take out] same, for they-have-been-fearing the people.
\v 3 Moreover, [the] Satan/adversary comes-into into Judas, the being-upon-called Iscariot, being out of{the number} of{the twelve},
\v 4 and, come[ing]-off/away, he-speaks-together to{the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests]} and to{the officers} the how he-may-give-aside/deliver same to{same[plural]},

\v 7 Moreover, the day of{the unleavened} comes in to{which} it-has-been-necessitating the passover to-be-being-sacrificed,
\v 8 and he-sends-off/away Peter and John, say[ing], "Be[ing]-gone, prepare to{us} the passover, in-which-place we-may-eat."
\v 9 Moreover, the say to{same}, "Where[?] you-are-will-ing we-may-prepare[?]"
\v 10 Moreover, the says to{same}, "Behold, of{you come[ing]-into} into the city, [a] man will-meet-together to{you} bearing[weight] [a] pot of{water}. Accompany to{same} into the home of{which} he-is-being-gone-into,

\v 12 and-the-there will-show to{you} [a] large up[from]ground[room] having-been-spread. Prepare there."
\v 13 Moreover, come[ing]-off/away, they-discover according-as he-has-said to{same}, and they-prepare the passover,
\v 14 and when the hour becomes, he-falls-anew[i.e. sits down], and the twelve sent-off[one]s together-with to{same},
\v 15 and he-says toward same, "To{desire-upon-ia} I-desire-upon the-same, the passover, to-eat alongside of{you} before of{the} me to-suffer,
\v 16 for I-am-saying to{you} that not-still, no, I-should_not_eat out of{same} until of{when} it-may-be-fulfilled in to{the kingdom} of{the God},"
\v 17 and, receive[ing] [the] cup, well-favor[ing]/give[ing]-thanks, he-says, "Take the-same and divide-through to{sameselves},
\v 18 for I-am-saying to{you} that no, I-should_not_drink, from of{the} now, from of{the become-effect} of{the vine}, until of{when} the kingdom of{the God} may-come,"
\v 19 and, take[ing] bread, well-favor[ing]/give[ing]-thanks, he-breaks and gives to{same}, saying, "The-same is-being the body of{me}, the over/for-the-sake of{you} being-given. Be-doing the-same into the mine remembrance-anew."
\v 20 As-same-ly also the cup alongside the to-dine/sup, saying, "The-same, the cup, the new through-placement/disposition/covenant in to{the blood} of{me}, the over/for-the-sake of{you} being-poured-out.
\v 21 More-ly, behold, the hand of{the giving-aside/delivering} me alongside of{emphatically-me} upon of{the table}
\v 22 and, on-one-hand, the son of{the man} is-being-gone according-to the having-been-defined; more-ly, woe to{the man, the-there} through of{whom} he-is-being-given-aside/delivered,"
\v 23 and same[plural] initiate to-be-seeking-together toward sameselves the who consequently might-be-being out of{same} the being-about to-be-practicing the-same.
\v 24 Moreover, also [a] fond-of-quarrel-ia/competition/rivalry becomes in to{same}, the who of{same} is-esteeming to-be-being greater.
\v 25 Moreover, the says to{same}, "The kings of{the nations} are-lording of{same} and the[plural] authority-izing of{same}. Good-workers/benefactors are-being-called;
\v 26 moreover, you not the-same-ly; contrariwise, the greater in to{you}: become as the younger, and the governing as the serving,

\v 31 Moreover, the Lord says, "Simon, Simon, behold, the Satan/adversary gives-cause/requests-out-for-self you[plural] of{the} to-sift as the grain.
\v 32 Moreover, I am-necessitated about of{you} in-which-place the faith of{you} should_not_quit/forsake/abandon-out, and you, at-what-time, turn[ing]-upon, establish the brothers of{you}."
\v 33 Moreover, the says to{same}, "Lord, alongside of{you} I-am-being also ready to-be-being-gone into custody and into death."
\v 34 Moreover, the says, "I-am-saying to{you}, Peter, no, [a] rooster will_not_sound today prior than thrice you-will-deny-off/away to-have_not_beheld me,"
\v 35 and he-says to{same}, when I-send-off/away you apart-from of{purse} and of{bag} and of{footwear}, no, of{any[?]} you-are-deficient/lack[?]" Moreover, the say, "Of{nothing}."
\v 36 So, he-says to{same}; "Contrariwise, now the having purse: lift. Similarly also bag, and the not having: sell the outer-garment of{same} and purchase [a] knife,
\v 37 for I-am-saying to{you} that still the-same, the having-been-written, is-necessitating to-be-completed in to{emphatically-me}, the also 'he-is-word-ized/reckoned/accounted alongside of{lawless},' for also the about of{emphatically-me} is-having completion."
\v 38 Moreover, the say, "Lord, behold, two knives here." Moreover, the says to{same}, "It-is-being sufficient,"
\v 39 and, come[ing]-out, he-is-gone according-to the custom into the mountain of{the olives}; moreover, also the disciples of{same} accompany to{same}.
\v 40 Moreover, become[ing] upon of{the place}, he-says to{same}, "Be-praying to_not_come-into into trial-ization,"
\v 41 and same is-drawn-off/away-from from of{same} as-if cast[noun] of{stone} and, place[ing] the knees, he-has-been-praying,
\v 42 saying, "Father, if you-are-intending, carry-aside the cup, the-same, from of{emphatically-me}; more-ly, not the will-effect of{me}; contrariwise, the yours: be-become."
\v 43 Moreover, [a] messenger from of{heaven} is-seen to{same}, in-strengthening same,
\v 44 and become[ing] in to{contend-ia/struggle-ia/agony-ia} he-has-been-praying fervently; moreover, the sweat of{same} becomes as-if clots/coagulations of{blood} descending upon the ground,

\v 46 and he-says to{same}, "What[?] you-are-lying-asleep[?] Stand[ing]-up, be-praying in-which-place you-should_not_come-into into trial-ization."
\v 47 Moreover, still of{same speaking}, behold, [a] crowd, and the being-said "Judas," into of{the twelve}, has-been-coming-before same, and becomes-near to{the Jesus} to-fond same.
\v 48 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "Judas, you-are-giving-aside/delivering the son of{the man} to{fond-effect}[?]"
\v 49 Moreover, behold[ing] the will-be[ing], the around same say to{same}, "Lord, if we-will-smite in to{knife}[?],"
\v 50 and some one out of{same} smites the slave of{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]} and lifts-off/away of{same} the ear, the right.
\v 51 Moreover, respond[ing], the Jesus says, "Be-allowing until of{the-same}," and, take[ing]-hold of{the ear} of{same}, he-cures same.
\v 52 Moreover, the Jesus says toward the become-aside upon same, chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and officers of{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} and elders, "As upon [a] robber you-come-out alongside of{knives} and of{wood[en clubs]}.
\v 53 According-to day [i.e. day by day] of{me being} alongside of{you} in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} you-do_not_stretch-out the hands upon emphatically-me; contrariwise, same[singular] is-being of{you} the hour and the authority of{the darkness}."
\v 54 Moreover, together-take[ing] same, they-lead, and they-into-lead same into the house of{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}. Moreover, the Peter has-been-accompanying afar.
\v 55 Moreover, of{kindle[ing]} [a] fire in to{midst} of{the courtyard} and of{same be[ing]-seated-together}, the Peter has-been-being-seated in to{midst} of{same}.
\v 56 Moreover, behold[ing] same, some girlie being-seated toward the light and fixate[ing] to{same} says, "Also the-same has-been-being together-with to{same}."
\v 57 Moreover, the denies same, saying, "Woman, I-have_not_beheld same,"
\v 58 and alongside [a] bit, [a] different-other, behold[ing] same, has-been-asserting, "Also, you are-being out of{same}." Moreover, the Peter says, "Man, I-am_not_being,"
\v 59 and of{stand[ing]-through/apart} as-if of{one hour}, some other has-been-being-through-strength-izing/persisting/maintaining, saying, "Upon of{truth} also the-same has-been-being alongside of{same}, for also he-is-being [a] Galilean."
\v 60 Moreover, the Peter says, "Man, I-have_not_beheld what you-are-saying," and immediately, still of{same speaking} [a] rooster sounds,
\v 61 and, turned, the Lord views-in to{the Peter}, and the Peter is-reminded-under of{the word} of{the Lord} as he-says to{same} that "prior to-sound [a] rooster, you-will-deny-off/away me thrice,"
\v 62 and, come[ing]-out outside, the Peter weeps bitterly,
\v 63 and the men, the together-holding the Jesus, have-been-infantilizing to{same}, flaying
\v 64 and cover[ing]-around same, they-have-been-beating the face of{same} and have-been-asking-upon same, saying, "Prophesy. Who[?] is-being the strike[ing] you[?],"
\v 65 and they-have-been-saying many different-others, asserting-evil into same,
\v 66 and as day becomes, the eldership of{the people} is-gathered, both chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and scribes, and lead-up/anew same into the council of{same}, saying,
\v 67 "If you are-being the Anointed, say to{us}." Moreover, he-says to{same}, "If-supposing I-would-say to{you}, no, you-would_not_believe.
\v 68 Moreover, if-supposing also I-would-ask, no, you-would_not_respond to{me} or you-would-loose-off/away.
\v 69 From of{the} now it-will-be the son of{the man} being-seated out of{right} of{the enablement/empowerment} of{the God}."
\v 70 Moreover, they-say, all, "So, you are-being the Son of{the God}[?]" Moreover, the has-been-asserting toward same, "You are-saying that I am-being."
\v 71 Moreover, the say, "Still what[?] need we-are-having of{witness-ia}[?], for same[plural] we-hear from of{the mouth} of{same},"
\c 23
\v 1 and, stand[ing]-up/anew, emphatically-all the multitude of{same}, leads same upon the Pilate.
\v 2 Moreover, they-initiate to-be-accusing of{same}, saying, "We-discover the-same through-turning/twisting/distorting the nation of{us} and hindering to-be-giving tributes to{Caesar}, saying sameself to-be-being Anointed[noun] king."
\v 3 Moreover, the Pilate asks-upon same, saying, "You are-being the king of{the Judeans}[?]" Moreover, the, respond[ing] to{same}, has-been-asserting, "You are-saying."
\v 4 Moreover, the Pilate says toward the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the crowds, "I-am-discovering not-one cause in to{the man, the-same}."
\v 5 Moreover, the[plural] have-been-having-strength-upon, saying that he-is-shaking-up/anew the people, teaching down/against of{the whole Judea}, initiate[ing]/initiated from of{the Galilee} until here.
\v 6 Moreover, Pilate, hear[ing] "Galilee," asks-upon if the man is-being Galilean,
\v 7 and, upon-know[ing] that he-is-being out of{the authority} of{Herod}, he-dispatches-anew same toward Herod, same also being in to{Jerusalems} in to{the-same, the days}.
\v 8 Moreover, the Herod, behold[ing] the Jesus, is-joyed extremely, for he-has-been-being will-ing out of{sufficient} to-behold same through the to-be-hearing much about of{same} and has-been-expect[ize]ing what[?] sign to-behold being-become under of{same}.
\v 9 Moreover, he-has-been-asking-upon same in to{sufficient words}; moreover, same responds nothing to{same}.
\v 10 Moreover, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the scribes had-stood strenuously accusing of{same}.
\v 11 Moreover, nothing[ing]-out/discount[ing] same, the Herod, together-with to{the armaments} of{same}, and infantilize[ing], drape[ing]-around same [with] shining attire, dispatches-anew same to{the Pilate}.
\v 12 Moreover, the both Pilate and the Herod become friends in to{same, the day} alongside of{one-another}, for they-have-been-being-before-under-originating in to{hostility}, being toward sameselves.
\v 13 Moreover, Pilate, call[ing]-together the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the chiefs and the people,
\v 14 says toward same, "You-carry-toward to{me} the man, the-same, as turning-off/away the people and, behold, I, in-sight of{you}, judge[ing]-anew, discover nothing in to{the man, the-same}, of{which} cause you-are-accusing down/against/according-to of{same}.
\v 15 Contrariwise, moreover-not Herod, for he-dispatches-anew same toward us and, behold, nothing worthwhile of{death} is-being having-been-practiced to{same}.
\v 16 So, child[ing]/chastise[ing] same, I-will-loose-off/away."
\v 17 Moreover, he-has-been-having compulsion to-be-loosing-off/away to{same} one according-to [the] festival.
\v 18 Moreover, they-cry-out-anew all-multitude-ly, saying, "Be-lifting the-same; moreover, loose-off to{us} the bar-Abbas,"
\v 19 the-who has-been-being through some stand-sis[i.e. state of standing] becomed in to{the city} and murder, having-been-cast into custody.
\v 20 So, again the Pilate sounds-toward, will-ing to-loose-off/away the Jesus.
\v 21 Moreover, the[plural] have-been-sounding-upon, saying, "Crucify, crucify same."
\v 22 Moreover, the says third[ly] toward same, "For what[?] bad the-same does[?] I-discover not-one cause of{death} in to{same}. So, child[ing]/chastise[ing] same, I-will-loose-off/away."
\v 23 Moreover, the have-been-being-lain-upon to{large sounds} giving-cause/requesting-for-selves same to-be-crucified and the sounds of{same} have-been-having-strength-against, and of{the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests]},
\v 24 moreover, the Pilate judges-upon the cause/request-effect to-become of{same[plural]}.
\v 25 Moreover, he-looses-off/away to{same} the through stand-sis[i.e. state of standing] and murder having-been-cast into the custody, whom they-have-been-giving-cause/requesting-for-selves; moreover, he-gives-aside/delivers the Jesus to{the will-effect} of{same},
\v 26 and as they-lead-off/away same, take[ing]-upon of{Simon, some Cyrenian, the being-come} from of{field}, they-place-upon to{same} the cross to-be-carrying from-behind of{the Jesus}.
\v 27 Moreover, [a] vast multitude of{the people} has-been-accompanying to{same}, and of{women}, who also have-been-striking-selves and have-been-lamenting same.
\v 28 Moreover, turned toward same, the Jesus says, "Daughters [of-]Jerusalem, do_not_be-weeping upon emphatically-me; more-ly be-weeping upon sameselves and upon the offsprings of{you},
\v 29 that, behold, days are-being-come in to{which} they-will-say, 'Blessed, the steriles and cavity-ias which do_not_beget, and breasts which do_not_nurse.'
\v 30 Then they-will-initiate to-be-saying to{the mountains}, 'Fall upon us,' and to{the hills}, 'Cover us,'
\v 31 that if in to{the moist/wet wood} they-are-doing the-same, in to{the dry/withered} what[?] may-become[?]"
\v 32 Moreover, also two different-others, bad-workers/malefactors/criminals, have-been-being-led together-with to{same} to-be-lifted-up,
\v 33 and when they-come-off/away upon the place, the being-called "skull," there they-crucify same and the bad-workers/malefactors/criminals, whom on-one-hand out of{right}, whom on-the-other-hand out of{left}.
\v 34 Moreover, the Jesus has-been-saying, "Father, let-off/away to{same}, for they-have_not_beheld what they-are-doing." Moreover, parting/dividing-through-selves the outer-garments of{same}, they-cast lot,
\v 35 and the people had-stood observing. Moreover, also the chiefs together-with to{same} have-been-nose-izing-out/mocking-out, saying, "Others he-saves; [he:] save sameself, if the-same is-being the Anointed, the chosen of{the God}."
\v 36 Moreover, also the soldiers have-been-infantilizing to{same}, being-come-toward and carrying-toward to{same} vinegar,
\v 37 and saying, "If you are-being the king of{the Judeans}, save yourself."
\v 38 Moreover, also [a] writing-upon/inscription has-been-being having-been-written upon to{same} to{write-effects} to{Greek} and to{Latin} and to{Hebrew}, "The-same is-being the king of{the Judeans}."
\v 39 Moreover, one of{the hung bad-workers/malefactors/criminals} has-been-asserting-evil [to] same, saying, "If you are-being the Anointed, save yourself and us."
\v 40 Moreover, respond[ing], the different-other, adjudging-valuation-upon to{same}, has-been-asserting, "Nor you are-fearing the God, that in to{the same judge-effect/judgment} you-are-being,
\v 41 and we on-one-hand justly, for we-practice worthwhile of{which} we-are-taking-off/away; on-the-other-hand, the-same practices nothing out-of-place,"
\v 42 and he-has-been-saying to{the Jesus}, "Be-reminded of{me}, Lord, when-supposing you-may-come in to{the kingdom} of{you},"
\v 43 and the Jesus says to{same}, "Amen I-am-saying to{you} today alongside of{emphatically-me} you-will-be in to{the garden}."
\v 44 Moreover, it-has-been-being as-if [the] sixth hour and darkness becomes upon the whole land until of{[the] ninth hour},
\v 45 and the sun is-dark-ized and the spread-out-against-effect/curtain of{the temple} is-split midst,
\v 46 and, sound[ing] to{large sound}, the Jesus says, "Father, into [the] hands of{you} I-am-being-placed-aside[/placing-self-aside] the spirit of{me}," and, say[ing] the-same, he-breathes-out.
\v 47 Moreover, behold[ing] the be[ing]-become, the hundred-chief/centurion esteem-izes/glorifies the God, saying, "Being-ly/actually, the man, the-same, has-been-being just,"
\v 48 and all the together-be[ing]-become-beside crowds upon the observe-ia, the-same, observing the be[ing]-become, beating the chests/sternums of{sameselves}, have-been-returning.
\v 49 Moreover, all the[plural] known[adjective] of{same} had-stood afar, and the women accompanying-together to{same} from of{the Galilee}, seeing the-same,
\v 50 and, behold, [a] man to{name} "Joseph," [a] councilor originating-under, [a] beneficial man and just,
\v 51 the-same, has_not_been-being having-been-together-placed-according-to to{the intention} and to{the practice} of{same[plural]}, from of{Arimathea, [a] city} of{the Judeans}, and who same also has-been-toward-receiving the kingdom of{the God},
\v 52 the-same, come[ing]-toward to{the Pilate}, gives-cause/requests-for-self the body of{the Jesus},
\v 53 and, lift[ing]-down same, envelopes same to{linen} and places same in to{hewn-out-of-rock memorial-effect} of{which} has_not_been-being not-moreover-yet-ly not-one being-lain,
\v 54 and [the] day has-been-being preparation, and [the] sabbath has-been-upon-light-izing[i.e. becoming dawn].
\v 55 Moreover, the women, accompany[ing]-down/according-to, some-who have-been-being having-come-together to{same} out of{the Galilee}, spectate the memorial and as the body of{same} is-placed.
\v 56 Moreover, return[ing], they-prepare aromatics and ointments, and, on-one-hand, they-quiet-ize the sabbath, according-to the command;
\c 24
\v 1 on-the-other-hand, to{the one} of{the sabbaths} of{deep[i.e. dim/early] daybreak} they-come upon the memorial-effect, carrying which aromatics they-prepare, and some[feminine plural] together-with to{same[feminine plural]}.
\v 2 Moreover, they-discover the stone having-been-rolled-off/away from of{the memorial}
\v 3 and, come[ing]-into, they-do_not_discover the body of{the Lord Jesus},
\v 4 and it-becomes in to{the} to-be-being-perplexed-through same[feminine plural] about of{the-same[neuter singular]}, also, behold, two men stand-upon to{same[feminine plural]} in to{attire-sis-es[i.e. states of attire] flashing-out[like lightning]}.
\v 5 Moreover, of{same[feminine plural] become[ing] in-fear} and of{leaning} the face into the ground, they-say toward same[feminine plural], "What[?] you-are-seeking the being-alive alongside of{the dead}[?]
