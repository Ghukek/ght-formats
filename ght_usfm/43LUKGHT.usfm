\v 1 In to{origin} has-been-being the word and the word has-been-being toward the God and God has-been-being the word.
\v 2 The-same has-been-being in to{origin} toward the God.
\v 3 All through of{same} becomes and apart-from of{same} becomes moreover-not one which has-become.
\v 4 In to{same} being-alive[noun] has-been-being, and the being-alive[noun] has-been-being the light of{the men},
\v 5 and the light is-revealing in to{the darkness-ia}, and the darkness-ia does_not_take-according-to same.
\v 6 [A] man is-become, having-been-sent-off/away beside of{God}, name to{same} "John."
\v 7 The-same comes into witness-ia, in-which-place he-may-witness about of{the light}, in-which-place all may-believe through of{same}.
\v 8 The-there has_not_been-being the light; contrariwise, in-which-place he-may-witness about of{the light}.
\v 9 The light, the genuine, has-been-being, which is-light-izing every man coming into the world.
\v 10 In to{the world} he-has-been-being, and the world is-become through of{same}, and the world does_not_know same.
\v 11 He-comes into the[plural] own, and the[plural] own do_not_take-aside/along/near same.
\v 12 Moreover, as-many-as take same he-gives to{same} authority to-become offsprings of{God} to{the believing/entrusting} into the name of{same},
\v 13 who, not out of{bloods}, nor out of{will-effect} of{flesh}, nor out of{will-effect} of{[a] man}; contrariwise, out of{God} are-begotten,
\v 14 and the word becomes flesh, and tents/lodges/tabernacles in to{us}, and we-spectate the esteem/glory of{same}, as esteem/glory of{only-begotten} aside/beside/near of{[the] Father}, full of{grace/favor} and of{truth}.
\v 15 John is-witnessing about of{same}, and has-cried-out, saying, "The-same has-been-being whom I-say the behind of{me}, being-come, in-front of{me} has-become, that first of{me} he-has-been-being,"
\v 16 and out of{the full-effect} of{same} we all take also grace/favor in-place-of of{grace/favor},
\v 17 that the law through of{Moses} is-given; the grace/favor and the truth through of{Jesus Anointed} becomes.
\v 18 Not-one has-seen God ever-yet. The only-begotten son, the being into the bosom/lap of{the father}, the-there governs/guides/directs/decrees-out,
\v 19 and the witness-ia of{the John} is-being the-same when the Judeans send-off/away consecrateds[i.e. priests] and Levites out of{Jerusalems} in-which-place they-may-ask same, "You are-being who[?],"
\v 20 and he-acknowledges, and does_not_deny, and acknowledges that "I am_not_being the Anointed,"
\v 21 and they-ask same, "So, what[?] Elijah you are-being[?]," and he-is-saying, "I-am_not_being." "The prophet you are-being[?]," and he-responds, "Not."
\v 22 So, they-say to{same}, "Who[?] you-are-being, in-which-place we-may-give response to{the dispatch[ing]} us[?] What[?] you-are-saying about of{yourself}[?]"
\v 23 He-has-been-asserting, "I, 'Sound of{crying} in to{the desolate}. Straighten the way of{[the] Lord},'["] according-as Isaiah the prophet says,["]
\v 24 and the having-been-sent-off/away have-been-being out of{the Pharisees},
\v 25 and they-ask same and say to{same}, "So, what[?] you-are-immersing if you are_not_being the Anointed nor Elijah nor the prophet[?]"
\v 26 The John responds to{same}, saying, "I am-immersing in to{water}; moreover, midst of{you} has-stood whom you have_not_beheld.
\v 27 Same is-being the behind of{me} being-come whom in-front of{me} has-become of{whom} I am_not_being worthwhile in-which-place I-may-loose of{same} the strap of{the footwear}."
\v 28 The-same[neuter] becomes in to{Bethany}, other-side of{the Jordan}, which-where John has-been-being immersing.
\v 29 To{the} upon-the-next-day, he-is-viewing the Jesus being-come toward same, and he-is-saying, "Behold, the lamb of{the God}, the lifting the sin of{the world}.
\v 30 The-same is-being about of{whom} I say, 'Behind of{me} is-being-come [a] man who in-front of{me} has-become,' that he-has-been-being first of{me},
\v 31 and-I had_not_beheld same; contrariwise, in-which-place it-may-be-revealed to{the Israel} through the-same, I come in to{water} immersing,"
\v 32 and John witnesses, saying that "I-have-spectated the spirit descending as-if [a] pigeon/dove out of{heaven} and he-stays upon same,
\v 33 and-I had_not_beheld same; contrariwise, the dispatch[ing] me to-be-immersing in to{water}, the-there says to{me}, 'Upon whom supposing you-may-behold the spirit descending and staying upon same, the-same is-being the immersing in to{[the] Holy Spirit},'
\v 34 and-I have-seen and have-witnessed that the-same is-being the Son of{the God}."
\v 35 To{the} upon-the-next-day again the John had-stood, and two out of{the disciples} of{same}
\v 36 and, view[ing]-in to{the Jesus walking-around}, he-is-saying, "Behold, the lamb of{the God},"
\v 37 and the two disciples hear of{same speaking} and accompany to{the Jesus}.
\v 38 Moreover, turned, the Jesus, also spectate[ing] same accompanying, is-saying to{same}, "What[?] you-are-seeking[?]" Moreover, the say to{same}, "Rabbi," the is-being-said is-being-meant "Teacher," "Where[?] you-are-staying[?]"
\v 39 He-is-saying to{same}, "Be-being-come and behold." So, they-come and behold where he-is-staying and beside to{same} stay the day, the-there; moreover, [the] hour has-been-being as [the] tenth,
\v 40 Andrew, the brother of{Simon Peter} has-been-being into out of{the two, the hear[ing]} beside of{John} and of{accompany[ing]} to{same}.
\v 41 The-same first is-discovering the brother, the own, Simon, and is-saying to{same}, "We-have-discovered the Messiah[Hebrew translit. 'anointed']," the is-being being-translated, "the anointed,"
\v 42 and he-leads same toward the Jesus. Moreover, view[ing]-in to{same}, the Jesus says, "You are-being Simon, the son of{Jona}. You will-be-called Cephas," which is-being-meant "rock."
\v 43 To{the} upon-the-next-day, he-wills to-come-out into the Galilee, and is-discovering Philip, and the Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Be-accompanying to{me}."
\v 44 Moreover, the Philip has-been-being from Bethsaida, out of{the city} of{Andrew} and of{Peter}.
\v 45 Philip is-discovering the Nathanael, and is-saying to{same}, "We-have-discovered whom Moses writes in to{the law} and the prophets, Jesus, the son of{the} Joseph, the from Nazareth,"
\v 46 and Nathanael says to{same}, "Out [of-]Nazareth is-being-enabled what[?] beneficial to-be-being[?]" Philip is-saying to{same}, "Be-being-come and behold."
\v 47 The Jesus beholds the Nathanael being-come toward same and is-saying about of{same}, "Behold truly [an] Israelite in to{whom} bait is_not_being."
\v 48 Nathanael is-saying to{same}, "Whence you-are-knowing me[?]" Jesus responds and says to{same}, "Before of{the} Philip to-sound you, being under the fig-tree, I-behold you."
\v 49 Nathanael responds and is-saying to{same}, "Rabbi, you are-being the Son of{the God}. You are-being the king of{the} Israel."
\v 50 Jesus responds and says to{same} that "I-say to{you}, I-behold you down-under of{the fig-tree}. You-are-believing. You-will-see greater of{the-same},"
\v 51 and he-is-saying to{same}, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} from presently you-will-see the heaven having-been-opened-up and the messengers of{the God} ascending and descending upon the son of{the man},"
\c 2
\v 1 and to{the day, the third} [a] wedding becomes in Cana of{the Galilee}, and the mother of{the Jesus} has-been-being there.
\v 2 Moreover, also the Jesus is-called, and the disciples of{same}, into the wedding,
\v 3 and of{wine be[ing]-deficient}, the mother of{the Jesus} is-saying toward same, "They-are_not_having wine,"
\v 4 and the Jesus is-saying to{same}, "What[?] to{emphatically-me} and to{you}, woman[?] Not-yet the hour of{me} has-arrived."
\v 5 The mother of{same} is-saying to{the servants}, "Which what[?] supposing he-may-be-saying to{you}, do."
\v 6 Moreover, six stone water-vessels have-been-being there, being-lain according-to the cleansing of{the Judeans}, making-space-for up/anew two or three measures.
\v 7 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Fill-ize the water-vessels of{water}," and they-fill-ize same until up,
\v 8 and he-is-saying to{same}, "Draw/drain now and be-carrying to{the chief-three[wall]-couch-er/chief-triclinium[Roman term]}," and they-carry.
\v 9 Moreover, as the chief-three[wall]-couch-er/chief-triclinium[Roman term] tastes the water having-become wine, and he-had_not_beheld whence it-is-being; moreover, the servants had-beheld the having-been-drawn/drained the water, the chief-three[wall]-couch-er/chief-triclinium[Roman term] is-sounding the bridegroom,
\v 10 and is-saying to{same}, "Every man first is-placing the good wine, and when-supposing they-may-be-drunk, then the inferior. You have-kept the good wine until presently."
\v 11 The Jesus does the-same origin of{the signs} in to{Cana} of{the Galilee}, and reveals the esteem/glory of{same}, and the disciples of{same} believe/entrust into same.
\v 12 Alongside the-same[neuter], same descends into Capernaum, and the mother of{same} and the brothers of{same} and the disciples of{same} also stay there not many days,
\v 13 and the passover of{the Judeans} has-been-being near, and the Jesus ascends into Jerusalem,
\v 14 and he-discovers in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} the selling oxen and sheep and pigeons/doves, and the cash-change-makers being-seated,
\v 15 and, make[ing] [a] whip out of{rush-cordlets/ropelets}, he-casts-out all out of{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, both the sheep and the oxen, and of{the money-changers} he-pours-out the cash and turns-up the tables,
\v 16 and to{the selling} the pigeons/doves he-says, "Lift the-same from-here. Do_not_be-making the house of{the father} of{me} [a] house of{market/trade/commerce/emporium}."
\v 17 Moreover, the disciples of{same} remember that it-is-being having-been-written, "The zeal of{the house} of{you} will-eat-down[i.e. consume] me."
\v 18 So, the Judeans respond and say to{same}, "What[?] sign you-are-showing to{us} that you-are-doing the-same[?]"
\v 19 Jesus responds and says to{same}, "Loose the temple, the-same, and in to{three days} I-will-rouse same."
\v 20 So, the Judeans say, "To{forty and six years} the temple, the-same, is-house-built, and you in to{three days} will-rouse same[?]"
\v 21 Moreover, the-there has-been-saying about of{the temple} of{the body} of{same}.
\v 22 So, when he-is-roused out of{dead}, the disciples of{same} remember that he-has-been-saying the-same and believe to{the scripture} and to{the word which} the Jesus says.
\v 23 Moreover, as he-has-been-being in to{Jerusalems} in to{the passover} in to{the festival}, many believe into the name of{same}, observing of{same} the signs which he-has-been-doing.
\v 24 Moreover, same, the Jesus, has_not_been-entrusting sameself to{same[plural]} through the same[singular] to-be-knowing all,
\v 25 also that he-has_not_been-having need in-which-place any may-witness about of{the man}, for same has-been-knowing what has-been-being in to{the man}.
\c 3
\v 1 Moreover, [a] man has-been-being out of{the Pharisees}, "Nicodemus" name to{same}, [a] chief of{the Judeans}.
\v 2 The-same comes toward same of{night} and says to{same}, "Rabbi, we-have-beheld that [a] teacher from of{God} you-have-come, for not-one is-being-enabled/empowered to-be-doing the signs, the-same, which you are-doing, if-supposing the God would_not_be-being alongside of{same}."
\v 3 Jesus responds and says to{same}, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, if-supposing no any/someone would-be-begotten up/anew-place-ly, he-is_not_being-enabled to-behold the kingdom of{the God}."
\v 4 The Nicodemus is-saying toward same, "How[?] [a] man is-being-enabled to-be-begotten being old-age[?] He-is_not_being-enabled to-come-into into the cavity-ia of{the mother} of{same} second[ly] and to-be-begotten."
\v 5 Jesus responds, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, if-supposing no any/someone would-be-begotten out of{water} and of{spirit}, he-is_not_being-enabled to-come-into into the kingdom of{the God}.
\v 6 The having-been-begotten out of{the flesh} is-being flesh and the having-been-begotten out of{the spirit} is-being spirit.
\v 7 You-should_not_marvel that I-say to{you} it-is-necessitating you to-be-begotten up/anew-place-ly.
\v 8 The breath-effect/blow-effect/wind/spirit, which-where it-is-will-ing, is-breathing/blowing, and you-are-hearing the sound of{same}; contrariwise, you-have_not_beheld whence it-is-being-come and where it-is-withdrawing. The-same-ly is-being all the having-been-begotten out of{the spirit}."
\v 9 Nicodemus responds and says to{same}, "How[?] the-same is-being-enabled to-become[?]"
\v 10 Jesus responds and says to{same}, "You are-being the teacher of{the} Israel and you-are_not_knowing the-same[plural].
\v 11 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, that we-have-beheld what we-are-speaking and what we-have-seen. We-are-witnessing, and you[plural]-are_not_taking the witness-ia of{us}.
\v 12 If I-say to{you} the upon-earthly and you-are_not_believing, how[?], if-supposing I-may-say to{you} the upon-heavenly, you-will-believe[?],
\v 13 and not-one has-ascended into the heaven if not the out of{the heaven} descend[ing], the son of{the man}, the being in to{the heaven},
\v 14 and according-as Moses elevates the serpent in to{the desolate}, the-same-ly it-is-necessitating the son of{the man} to-be-elevated,
\v 15 in-which-place every, the believing/entrusting into same, would_not_perish-off/away; contrariwise, may-be-having eternal being-alive[noun],
\v 16 for the-same-ly the God loves the world, such-as he-gives the son of{same}, the only-begotten, in-which-place every, the believing/entrusting into same, would_not_perish-off/away; contrariwise, may-be-having eternal being-alive[noun],
\v 17 for the God does_not_send-off/away the son of{same} into the world in-which-place he-may-be-judging the world; contrariwise, in-which-place the world may-be-saved through of{same}.
\v 18 The believing/entrusting into same is_not_being-judged; moreover, the not believing/entrusting already has-been-judged, that he-has_not_believed/entrusted into the name of{the only-begotten son} of{the God}.
\v 19 Moreover, the-same is-being the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment], that the light has-come into the world, and the men love more the darkness than the light, for the works of{same} has-been-being evil,
\v 20 for every, the practicing insignificant/unimportant/mediocre/careless/indifferent/negligible, is-hating the light and is_not_being-come toward the light in-which-place the works of{same} would_not_be-confuted.
\v 21 Moreover, the doing the truth is-being-come toward the light in-which-place the works of{same} may-be-revealed that in to{God} is-being having-been-work-ized[plural]."
\v 22 Alongside the-same[neuter] the Jesus comes, and the disciples of{same}, into the Judean land, and there he-has-been-engaging alongside of{same}, and has-been-immersing.
\v 23 Moreover, also John has-been-being immersing in Aenon near of{the Salim}, that many waters has-been-being there, and they-have-been-becoming-aside/beside and have-been-being-immersed,
\v 24 for not-yet the John has-been-being having-been-cast into the custody.
\v 25 So, seek-sis[i.e. state of seeking]/inquiry becomes out of{the disciples} of{John} alongside of{Judeans} about of{cleansing},
\v 26 and they-come toward the John and say to{same}, "Rabbi, who has-been-being alongside of{you}, other-side of{the Jordan}, to{whom} you have-witnessed, behold, the-same is-immersing and all are-being-come toward same."
\v 27 John responds and says "[A] man is_not_being-enabled to-be-taking not-one if-supposing it-may_not_be-being having-been-given to{same} out of{the heaven}.
\v 28 The-same[masculine plural] you[plural] are-witnessing to{me} that I-say I am_not_being the Anointed; contrariwise, that I-am-being having-been-sent-off/away in-front of{the-there}.
\v 29 The having the bride is-being bridegroom; moreover, the friend of{the bridegroom}, the having-stood and hearing of{same} is-joying to{joy} through the sound of{the bridegroom}; so, the same joy, the mine, has-been-fulfilled.
\v 30 It-is-necessitating the-there to-be-growing/increasing; moreover, emphatically-me to-be-being-diminished."
\v 31 The up-place-ly being-come is-being up-upon of{all}. The being out of{the earth} is-being out of{the earth}, and out of{the earth} is-speaking. The out of{the heaven} being-come is-being up-upon of{all},
\v 32 and what he-has-seen and hears is-witnessing the-same[neuter], and not-one is-taking the witness-ia of{same[masculine]}.
\v 33 The take[ing] the witness-ia of{same} affixes-with-seal that the God is-being true,
\v 34 for whom the God sends-off/away is-speaking the say-effects/statements of{the God}, for not out of{measure} the God is-giving the Spirit.
\v 35 The Father is-loving the Son and has-given all in to{the hand} of{same}.
\v 36 The believing/entrusting into the Son is-having eternal being-alive[noun]; moreover, the being-unpersuaded/stubborn/noncompliant to{the son} will_not_see being-alive[noun]; contrariwise, the wrath of{the God} is-remaining upon same.
\c 4
\v 1 So, as the Lord knows that the Pharisees hear that Jesus is-making and is-immersing much-more disciples than John,
\v 2 and-to-which-yet same Jesus has_not_been-immersing; contrariwise, the disciples of{same},
\v 3 he-lets-off/away the Judea and comes-off/away again into the Galilee.
\v 4 Moreover, it-has-been-necessitating same to-be-being-come-through through of{the Samaria}.
\v 5 So, he-is-being-come into [a] city of{the Samaria} being-said "Sychar" nearby of{the region} which Jacob gives [to-]Joseph, to{the son} of{same}.
\v 6 Moreover, [the] fountain of{the} Jacob has-been-being there, so, the Jesus, having-been-toiled out of{the way-going-ia} has-been-being-seat-ized the-same-ly upon to{the fountain}. It-has-been-being as-if [the] sixth hour.
\v 7 [A] woman out of{the Samaria} is-being-come to-drain/draw water. The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Give to{me} to-drink,"
\v 8 for the disciples of{same} had-come-off/away into the city in-which-place they-may-purchase nourishments.
\v 9 So, the woman, the Samaritess, is-saying to{same}, "How[?], you being Judean aside of{emphatically-me}, are-giving-cause-to/requesting to-drink of{being woman Samaritess}, for Judeans are_not_together-requiring/cooperating to{Samaritans}[?]"
\v 10 Jesus responds and says to{same}, "If you-had-beheld the gratuity of{the God} and who is-being the saying to{you}, 'Give to{me} to-drink,' supposing you give-cause-to/request same, and supposing he-gives to{you} being-alive water."
\v 11 The woman is-saying to{same}, "Lord, nor you-are-having draw/drain-effect/bucket/pail and the cistern/tank/reservoir/well is-being deep. So, whence[?] you-are-having the water, the being-alive[?]
\v 12 You are_not_being greater of{the father} of{us}, Jacob, who gives to{us} the cistern/tank/reservoir/well, and same drinks out of{same}, and the sons of{same}, and the nourish-effects of{same}."
\v 13 Jesus responds and says to{same}, "Every, the drinking out of{the water, the-same} will-thirst again;
\v 14 moreover, who supposing may-drink out of{the water which} I will-give to{same}, no, he-would_not_thirst into the eon. Contrariwise, the water which I-will-give to{same} will-become in to{same} [a] fountain of{water leaping} into eternal being-alive[noun]."
\v 15 The woman is-saying toward same, "Lord, give to{me} the-same, the water, in-which-place I-would_not_be-thirsting, nor would-be-being-come to-be-drawing/draining in-this-place."
\v 16 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Be-withdrawing. Sound the man of{you} and come in-this-place."
\v 17 The woman responds and says, "I-am_not_having [a] man." The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "You-say well, that 'I-am_not_having [a] man,'
\v 18 for you-have five men and now whom you-are-having is_not_being [a] man of{you}. You-have-said the-same true."
\v 19 The woman is-saying to{same}, "Lord, I-am-observing that you are-being [a] prophet.
\v 20 The fathers of{us} worship in to{the mountain, the-same}, and you[plural] are-saying that in to{Jerusalems} is-being the place which-where it-is-necessitating to-be-worshiping."
\v 21 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Woman, believe/entrust to{me} that [an] hour is-being-come when neither in to{the mountain, the-same} nor in to{Jerusalems} you[plural]-will-worship to{the Father}.
\v 22 You[plural] are-worshiping what you-have_not_beheld. We are-worshiping what we-have-beheld, that the salvation is-being out of{the Judeans}.
\v 23 Contrariwise, [an] hour is-being-come and now is-being when the genuine worshipers will-worship to{the Father} in to{spirit} and to{truth}, for also the Father is-seeking to-whom-the-same[plural], the worshiping same
\v 24 Spirit, and the God is-necessitating the[plural] worshiping same to-be-worshiping in to{spirit} and to{truth}."
\v 25 The woman is-saying to{same}, "I-have-beheld that Messiah[Hebrew translit. 'anointed'] is-being-come, the being-said 'Anointed.' When-supposing the-there may-come, he-will-message-up/anew all to{us}."
\v 26 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "I am-being, the speaking to{you},"
\v 27 and upon to{the-same}, the disciples of{same} come, and they-marvel that alongside of{[a] woman} he-has-been-speaking. Nevertheless, not-one says, "What[?] you-are-seeking[?]" or, "What[?] you-are-speaking alongside of{same[feminine]}[?]"
\v 28 So, the woman lets-off/away the water-vessel of{same}, and comes-off/away into the city, and is-saying to{the men},
\v 29 "Come!, behold [a] man who says to{me} all as-much-as I-do. No-what[?] the-same is-being the Anointed[?]"
\v 30 So, they-come-out out of{the city} and have-been-being-come toward same.
\v 31 Moreover, in to{the} between, the disciples have-been-asking same, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
\v 32 Moreover, the says to{same}, "I am-having eat-up-sis[i.e. state of consuming] to-eat which you have_not_beheld."
\v 33 So, the disciples have-been-saying toward one-another, "No, who[?] carries to{same} to-eat[?]"
\v 34 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "My consume-effect is-being in-which-place I-may-do the will-effect of{the dispatch[ing]} me and may-accomplish the work of{same}.
\v 35 Not[?] you are-saying that 'Still four-month is-being and the harvest is-being-come'[?] Behold, I-am-saying to{you} lift-upon the eyes of{you} and spectate the spaces that are-being white/bright/clear toward harvest already,
\v 36 and the harvesting is-taking wage and is-gathering fruit into eternal being-alive[noun] in-which-place the sowing and the harvesting may-be-joying of{like},
\v 37 for in to{the-same} the word is-being genuine that other[English "one"] is-being the sowing and [the] other the harvesting.
\v 38 I send-off/away you to-be-harvesting what you have_not_toiled. Others have-toiled, and you have-come-into into the toil of{same}."
\v 39 Moreover, out of{the city, the-there,} many of{the Samaritans} believe/entrust into same through the word of{the woman witnessing} that "he-says to{me} all as-much-as I-do."
\v 40 So, as the Samaritans come toward same, they-have-been-asking same to-stay beside to{same}, and he-stays there two days,
\v 41 and to{much} many-more believe through the word of{same}.
\v 42 Besides, to{the woman} they-have-been-saying that "not-still through the your speech we-are-believing, for same[we] have-heard and have-beheld that the-same is-being truly the savior of{the world}, the Anointed."
\v 43 Moreover, alongside the two days he-comes-out thence and comes-off/away into the Galilee,
\v 44 for same Jesus witnesses that [a] prophet in to{the own fatherland} is_not_having value.
\v 45 So, when he-comes into the Galilee, the Galileans receive same, having-seen all as-much-as he-does in to{Jerusalems} in to{the festival}, for also same come into the festival.
\v 46 So, again the Jesus comes into the Cana of{the Galilee}, which-where he-makes the water wine, and has-been-being some royal of{whom} the son has-been-being-infirm in Capernaum.
\v 47 The-same hear[ing] that Jesus has-arrived out of{the Judea} into the Galilee comes-off/away toward same and has-been-asking same in-which-place he-may-descend and may-cure the son of{same}, for he-has-been-being-about to-be-dying-off/away.
\v 48 So, the Jesus says toward same, "If-supposing you[plural]-may-behold no signs and miracles, no, you[plural]-would_not_believe."
\v 49 The royal is-saying toward same, "Lord, descend prior to-die-off/away the childling of{me}."
\v 50 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Be-being-gone. The son of{you} is-being-alive," and the man believes/entrusts to{the word which} the Jesus says to{same} and has-been-being-gone.
\v 51 Moreover, already of{same descending}, the slaves of{same} encounter to{same} and message-off/away, saying that "the child of{you} is-being-alive."
\v 52 So, he-ascertains aside of{same} the hour in to{which} he-has/holds more-refined-ly and they-say to{same} that yesterday seventh hour the fever lets-off/away-from same.
\v 53 So, the father knows that in to{the-there, the hour} in to{which} the Jesus says to{same} that "the son of{you} is-being-alive," and same believes, and the whole home of{same}.
\v 54 The Jesus does the-same second sign again come[ing] out of{the Judea} into the Galilee.
\c 5
\v 1 Alongside the-same [a] festival of{the Judeans} has-been-being, and the Jesus ascends into Jerusalem.
\v 2 Moreover, [a] pool, the being-said-upon Hebrew-ly, "Bethesda," is-being in to{the Jerusalems} upon to{the of-sheep[Nehemiah 3:1 "gate"]}, having five porticos/colonnades.
\v 3 In to{the-same[plural]} has-been-being-lain-down [a] vast multitude of{the being-weak/infirm, blind, lame, withered, receiving-out[i.e. waiting for]} the of{the water} move[noun],
\v 4 for [a] messenger according-to season has-been-descending in to{the pool} and has-been-disturbing the water, so, the first step[ing]-in alongside the disturbance of{the water} has-been-being-become healthy, to{which} sometimes he-has-been-being-held-down/according-to to{disease-effect}.
\v 5 Moreover, some man has-been-being there thirty and eight years, having in to{the infirmity} of{same}.
\v 6 The Jesus, behold[ing] the-same being-lain-down and know[ing] that already he-is-having much time, is-saying to{same}, "You-are-will-ing to-become healthy[?]"
\v 7 The being-infirm responds to{same}, "Lord, I-am_not_having [a] man in-which-place when-supposing the water may-be-disturbed he-may-cast me into the pool; moreover, in to{which} I am-being-come, another before of{emphatically-me} is-descending."
\v 8 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Rouse-self, lift the pallet/bed of{you} and be-walking-around,"
\v 9 and straightaway the man becomes healthy, and lifts the pallet/bed of{same}, and has-been-walking-around. Moreover, it-has-been-being [the] sabbath in to{the-there, the day}.
\v 10 So, the Judeans have-been-saying to{the having-been-healed}, "It-is-being [the] sabbath, and it-is_not_being-permitted to{you} to-lift the pallet/bed of{you}."
\v 11 He-responds to{same}, the make[ing] me healthy, the-there, says to{me}, "Lift the pallet/bed of{you} and be-walking-around."
\v 12 So, they-ask same, "Who[?] is-being the man, the say[ing] to{you}, 'Lift the pallet/bed of{you} and be-walking-around'[?]"
\v 13 Moreover, the cured had_not_beheld who he-is-being, for the Jesus nods-out/turns-aside of{[the] crowd being} in to{the place}.
\v 14 Alongside the-same, the Jesus is-discovering same in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} and says to{same}, "Behold, you-have-become healthy. No-still be-sinning, in-which-place no worse what to{you} may-become."
\v 15 The man comes-off/away and messages-anew to{the Judeans} that Jesus is-being the make[ing] same healthy,
\v 16 and through the-same the Judeans have-been-chasing the Jesus and have-been-seeking same to-kill-off/away, that he-has-been-doing the-same in to{[the] sabbath}.
\v 17 Moreover, the Jesus responds to{same}, "The Father of{me} until presently is-work-izing-self; also-I am-work-izing-self."
\v 18 So, through the-same, the Judeans more have-been-seeking same to-kill-off/away, that not only he-has-been-loosing the sabbath; contrariwise, also own Father he-has-been-saying the God, making equal sameself to{the God}.
\v 19 So, the Jesus responds and says to{same}, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, the Son is_not_being-enabled to-be-doing from of{sameself} not-one if-supposing not what he-may-be-viewing the Father doing, for what[plural] supposing the-there may-be-doing, also the Son similarly is-doing the-same,
\v 20 for the Father is-being-fond-of the Son and is-showing all to{same}, which same is-doing, and he-will-show greater works of{the-same[plural]} to{same}, in-which-place you should-be-marveling,
\v 21 for even-as the Father is-rousing the dead and is-making-alive, the-same-ly also the Son whom he-is-will-ing is-making-alive,
\v 22 for neither the Father is-judging, not-one; contrariwise, he-has-given the every judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment] to{the son},
\v 23 in-which-place all may-be-valuing the Son according-as they-are-valuing the Father. The not valuing the Son is_not_valuing the Father, the dispatch[ing] same.
\v 24 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that the hearing the word of{me} and believing/entrusting to{the dispatch[ing]} me is-having eternal being-alive[noun], and he-is_not_being-come into judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]; contrariwise, he-has-stepped-across/changed-course out of{the death} into the being-alive[noun].
\v 25 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that [an] hour is-being-come and now is-being when the dead will-hearken-to of{the sound} of{the son} of{the God} and the hear[ing] will-be-alive,
\v 26 for even-as the Father is-having being-alive[noun] in to{sameself}, the-same-ly he-gives being-alive[noun] also to{the son} to-be-having in to{sameself},
\v 27 and he-gives authority to{same} and judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment] to-be-making, that he-is-being son of{man}.
\v 28 Do_not_be-marveling the-same, that [an] hour is-being-come in to{which} all the in to{the memorials} will-hearken-to of{the sound} of{same}
\v 29 and the do[ing] the beneficial will-be-gone-out into stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection] of{being-alive[noun]}; moreover, the practice[ing] the insignificant/unimportant/mediocre/careless/indifferent/negligible into stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection] of{judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]}.
\v 30 I am_not_being-enabled to-be-doing from of{myself}, not-one. According-as I-am-hearing I-am-judging, and the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment], the mine, is-being just, that I-am_not_seeking the will-effect, the mine; contrariwise, the will-effect of{the Father dispatch[ing]} me.
\v 31 If-supposing I may-be-witnessing about of{myself}, the witness-ia of{me} is_not_being true.
\v 32 Another is-being the witnessing about of{emphatically-me}, and I-have-beheld that true is-being the witness-ia which he-is-witnessing about of{emphatically-me}.
\v 33 You have-sent-off/away toward John and he-has-witnessed to{the truth}.
\v 34 Moreover, I, not beside of{[a] man}, am-taking the witness-ia; contrariwise, I-am-saying the-same in-which-place you may-be-saved.
\v 35 The-there has-been-being the lamp, the being-ignited and revealing; moreover, you will to-be-exulted toward [an] hour in to{the light} of{same}.
\v 36 Moreover, I am-having the witness-ia greater-than of{the John}, for the works which the Father gives to{me} in-which-place I-may-accomplish same, the same works which I-am-doing, he-is-witnessing about of{emphatically-me}, that the Father has-sent-off/away me,
\v 37 and the same Father dispatch[ing] me has-witnessed about of{emphatically-me}. Neither you-have-heard sound of{same} ever-yet nor you-have-seen behold[noun] of{same},
\v 38 and the word of{same} you-are_not_having remaining in to{you}, that whom the-there sends-off/away, you are_not_believing/entrusting to{the-same}.
\v 39 You-are-investigating the scriptures, that you are-esteeming in to{same} to-be-having eternal being-alive[noun], and the-there-s are-being the witnessing about of{emphatically-me},
\v 40 and you-are_not_will-ing to-come toward me in-which-place you-may-be-having being-alive[noun].
\v 41 I-am_not_taking esteem/glory beside of{men};
\v 42 contrariwise, I-have-known you, that you-are_not_having the love of{the God} in to{sameselves}.
\v 43 I have-come in to{the name} of{the Father} of{me} and you-are_not_taking me. If-supposing another may-come in to{the name, the own}, you-will-take/get the-there.
\v 44 How[?] you are-being-enabled to-believe, taking esteem/glory beside of{one-another}, and you-are_not_seeking the esteem/glory, the beside of{the God alone [or, "only God"]}[?]
\v 45 Do_not_be-esteeming that I will-accuse of{you} toward the Father. The accusing of{you} is-being Moses, into whom you have-expect[ize]ed,
\v 46 for if supposing you-have-been-believing/entrusting to{Moses} you-have-been-believing/entrusting to{emphatically-me}, for about of{emphatically-me} the-there writes.
\v 47 Moreover, if to{the write-effects} of{the-there} you-are_not_believing/entrusting, how[?] you-will-believe/entrust to{the my say-effects/statements}[?]"
\c 6
\v 1 Alongside the-same, the Jesus comes-off/away, other-side of{the seawater} of{the Galilee} of{the Tiberias}.
\v 2 Moreover, [a] vast crowd has-been-accompanying to{same}, that they-have-been-observing of{same} the signs which he-has-been-doing upon of{the being-infirm}.
\v 3 Moreover, the Jesus comes-up into the mountain, and there he-has-been-being-seated alongside of{the disciples} of{same}.
\v 4 Moreover, the passover has-been-being near, the festival of{the Judeans}.
\v 5 So, the Jesus, lift[ing]-upon the eyes and spectate[ing] that [a] vast crowd is-being-come toward same, is-saying toward the Philip, "Whence[?] we-will-purchase breads in-which-place the-same may-eat[?]"
\v 6 Moreover, he-has-been-saying the-same, trial-izing same, for same had-beheld what he-has-been-being-about to-be-doing.
\v 7 Philip responds to{same}, "Breads of{two-hundred denarii} are_not_satisfying to{same} in-which-place each of{same} may-take some/any bit."
\v 8 One out of{the disciples} of{same}, Andrew, the brother of{Simon Peter}, is-saying to{same},
\v 9 "One childlingsie[double diminutive] is-being here, which is-having five barley breads and two side-portion-ies; contrariwise, what[?] the-same is-being into the-whom-the-same[?]"
\v 10 Moreover, the Jesus says, "Make the men to-fall-anew[i.e. sit down]." Moreover, much grass has-been-being in to{the place}, so, the men fall-anew[i.e. sit down], the number as-if five-thousand.
\v 11 Moreover, the Jesus takes the breads and, well-favor[ing]/give[ing]-thanks, gives-through/distributes to{the disciples}; moreover, the disciples to{the being-lain-up/anew}, similarly also out of{the side-portion-ies}, as-much-as they-have-been-will-ing.
\v 12 Moreover, as they-are-in-filled, he-is-saying to{the disciples} of{same}, "Gather the exceed[ing] break-effects in-which-place not any may-perish-off/away."
\v 13 So, they-gather and fill-ize twelve baskets of{break-effects} out of{the five breads, the barley} which exceeds to{the having-been-eaten-up}.
\v 14 So, the men, behold[ing], which sign the Jesus does, have-been-saying that the-same is-being truly the prophet, the being-come into the world.
\v 15 So, Jesus, know[ing] that they-are-being-about to-be-being-come and to-be-snatching same, in-which-place they-may-make same king, same alone separates-anew again into the mountain.
\v 16 Moreover, as late/evening becomes, the disciples of{same} descend upon the seawater,
\v 17 and, step[ing]-in into the boat, they-have-been-being-come other-side of{the seawater} into Capernaum, and darkness-ia already had-become, and the Jesus had_not_come toward same.
\v 18 Besides, the seawater has-been-being-roused-through of{[a] large wind blowing}.
\v 19 So, having-propelled as twenty-five or thirty stadia, they-are-observing the Jesus walking-around upon of{the seawater} and becoming near of{the boat}, and they-fear.
\v 20 Moreover, the is-saying to{same}, "I am-being. Do_not_be-fearing."
\v 21 So, they-have-been-will-ing to-take same into the boat, and straightaway the boat becomes upon of{the land} into which they-have-been-withdrawing.
\v 22 To{the} upon-the-next-day, the crowd, the having-stood other-side of{the seawater}, behold[ing] that another small-boat has_not_been-being there if not one, the-there, into which the disciples of{same} step-in, and that the Jesus does_not_come-into-together to{the disciples} of{same} into the boat; contrariwise only the disciples of{same} come-off/away;
\v 23 moreover, contrariwise, small-boats come out of{Tiberias} near of{the place} which-where they-eat the bread of{well-favor[ing]/give[ing]-thanks} of{the Lord}.
\v 24 So, when the crowd beholds that Jesus is_not_being there, nor the disciples of{same}, they-step-in, same, into the small-boats and come into Capernaum seeking the Jesus,
\v 25 and, discover[ing] same, other-side of{the seawater}, they-say to{same}, "Rabbi, at-what-time[?] you-have-become here[?]"
\v 26 The Jesus responds to{same} and says, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, you-are-seeking me not that you-behold signs; contrariwise, that you-eat out of{the breads} and are-fed-ized.
\v 27 Do_not_be-work-izing-selves the eat-up-sis[i.e. state of eating up], the perishing-off/away; contrariwise, the eat-up-sis[i.e. state of eating up], the remaining into eternal being-alive[noun], which the son of{the man} will-give to{you}, for the Father, the God, affixes-with-seal the-same[masculine]."
\v 28 So, they-say toward same, "What[?] we-may-be-doing in-which-place we-may-be-work-izing-selves, the works of{the God}[?]"
\v 29 The Jesus responds and says to{same}, "The-same is-being the work of{the God} in-which-place you-may-believe/entrust into whom the-there sends-off/away."
\v 30 So, they-say to{same}, "So, what[?] you are-doing sign in-which-place we-may-behold and may-believe/entrust to{you}[?] What[?] you-are-work-izing-self[?]
\v 31 The fathers of{us} eat the manna in to{the desolate} according-as it-is-being having-been-written, 'He-gives bread out of{the heaven} to{same} to-eat.'"
\v 32 So, the Jesus says to{same}, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, not Moses has-given to{you} the bread out of{the heaven}; contrariwise, the Father of{me} is-giving to{you} the bread out of{the heaven}, the genuine,
\v 33 for the bread of{the God} is-being the descending out of{the heaven} and giving being-alive[noun] to{the world}."
\v 34 So, they-say toward same, "Lord, always give to{us} the bread, the-same."
\v 35 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "I am-being the bread of{the being-alive[noun]}. The being-come toward me, no, would_not_hunger, and the believing/entrusting into emphatically-me, no, would_not_thirst ever-yet.
\v 36 Contrariwise, I-say to{you} that also you-have-seen me and you-are_not_believing.
\v 37 Every[thing] which the Father is-giving to{me} will-arrive toward emphatically-me and no, I-would_not_cast-out outside the[masculine] being-come toward me,
\v 38 that I-have-descended out of{the heaven} not in-which-place I-may-be-doing the will-effect, the mine; contrariwise, the will-effect of{the dispatch[ing]} me.
\v 39 Moreover, the-same is-being the will-effect of{the dispatch[ing]} me, in-which-place every[thing] which he-has-given to{me} would_not_lose/destroy-off/away out of{same}; contrariwise, I-will-stand-up/anew same in to{the last day}.
\v 40 Moreover, the-same is-being the will-effect of{the Father} of{me}, in-which-place every the observing the Son and believing/entrusting into same may-be-having eternal being-alive[noun], and I will-stand-up/anew same in to{the last day}."
\v 41 So, the Judeans have-been-murmuring/muttering/grumbling about of{same}, that he-says, "I am-being the bread, the descend[ing] out of{the heaven},"
\v 42 and they-have-been-saying, "Not[?] the-same is-being Jesus, the son [of-]Joseph, of{whom} we have-beheld the father and the mother[?] So, how[?] he-is-saying that 'out of{the heaven} I-have-descended[?]'"
\v 43 So, the Jesus responds and says to{same}, "Do_not_be-murmuring/muttering/grumbling alongside of{one-another}.
\v 44 Not-one is-being-enabled to-come toward me if-supposing, no, the Father, the dispatch[ing] me, may-pull same, and I will-stand-up/anew same in to{the last day}.
\v 45 It-is-being having-been-written in to{the prophets}, 'And all will-be taught[adjective] of{God},' so, every, the hear[ing] beside of{the Father} and learn[ing] is-being-come toward me.
\v 46 Not that anyone has-seen the Father, if not the being beside of{the God}. The-same has-seen the Father.
\v 47 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, the believing/entrusting into emphatically-me is-having eternal being-alive[noun].
\v 48 I am-being the bread of{the being-alive[noun]}.
\v 49 The fathers of{you} eat the manna in to{the desolate} and they-die-off/away.
\v 50 The-same is-being the bread, the out of{the heaven} descending, in-which-place who out of{same} may-eat and would_not_die-off/away.
\v 51 I am-being the bread, the being-alive, the out of{the heaven} descend[ing]. If-supposing anyone may-eat out of{the-same, the bread}, he-will-be-alive into the eon, and the bread, moreover, which I will-give, is-being the flesh of{me}, which I will-give, over/for-the-sake of{the being-alive[noun]} of{the world}."
\v 52 So, the Judeans have-been-fighting toward one-another, saying, "How[?] is-being-enabled, the-same, to-give to{us} the flesh to-eat[?]"
\v 53 So, the Jesus says to{same}, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, if-supposing, no, you-would-eat the flesh of{the son} of{the man} and would-drink of{same} the blood, you-are_not_having being-alive[noun] in to{sameselves}.
\v 54 The munching the flesh of{me} and drinking the blood of{me} is-having eternal being-alive[noun], and I will-stand-up/anew same in to{the last day},
\v 55 for the flesh of{me} is-being true eat-up-sis[i.e. state of eating up] and the blood of{me} is-being true drink-sis[i.e. state of drinking].
\v 56 The munching the flesh of{me} and drinking the blood of{me} is-remaining in to{emphatically-me}, and-I in to{same}.
\v 57 According-as the being-alive Father sends-off/away me, also-I am-being-alive through the Father, and the munching me, also-the-there will-be-alive through emphatically-me.
\v 58 The-same is-being the bread, the out of{the heaven} descend[ing], not according-as the fathers of{you} eat the manna and die-off/away. The munching the-same, the bread, will-be-alive into the eon."
\v 59 He-says the-same in to{[a] gathering[translit. "synagogue"]}, teaching in Capernaum.
\v 60 So, many hear[ing] out of{the disciples} of{same} say, "The-same, the word, is-being hard. Who[?] is-being-enabled of{same} to-be-hearing[?]"
\v 61 Moreover, the Jesus having-beheld in to{sameself} that the disciples of{same} are-murmuring/muttering/grumbling about of{the-same}, says to{same}, "The-same is-scandalizing you.
\v 62 So, if-supposing you-may-be-observing the son of{the man} ascending which-where the more-before he-has-been-being[?]
\v 63 The spirit is-being the making-alive; the flesh is_not_profiting, nothing. The say-effects/statements which I have-spoken to{you}, spirit is-being and being-alive[noun] is-being;
\v 64 contrariwise, some out of{you} are-being, who are_not_believing," for the Jesus had-beheld out of{origin} some are-being the not believing, and who is-being the will-give[ing]-aside/deliver[ing] same,
\v 65 and he-has-been-saying, "Through the-same I-have-said to{you} that not-one is-being-enabled to-come toward me if-supposing it-may_not_be-being having-been-given to{same} out of{the Father} of{me}.
\v 66 Out of{the-same}, many of{the disciples} of{same} come-off/away into the behind and not-still have-been-walking-around alongside of{same}.
\v 67 So, the Jesus says to{the} twelve, "No, also you are-will-ing to-be-withdrawing[?]"
\v 68 Simon Peter responds to{same}, "Lord, toward whom[?] we-will-come-off/away[?] You-are-having [the] say-effects/statements of{eternal being-alive[noun]},
\v 69 and we have-believed and have-known that you are-being the Anointed, the Son of{the God, the being-alive}."
\v 70 The Jesus responds to{same}, "Not[?] I choose you, the twelve[?], and out of{you} one is-being [a] devil/slanderous."
\v 71 Moreover, he-has-been-saying the Judas of{Simon Iscariot}, for the-same has-been-being-about to-be-giving-aside/delivering same, one being out of{the twelve},
\c 7
\v 1 and the Jesus has-been-walking-around alongside the-same[neuter] in to{the Galilee}, for he-has_not_been-will-ing to-be-walking-around in to{the Judea}, that the Judeans have-been-seeking same to-kill-off/away.
\v 2 Moreover, the festival of{the Judeans}, the tent-pitching-ia/booth-making-ia, has-been-being near.
\v 3 So, the brothers of{same} say toward same, "Step-across from-here and be-withdrawing into the Judea, in-which-place also the disciples of{you} may-observe the works of{you} which you-are-doing,
\v 4 for not-one is-doing anything in to{hidden[adjective]}, and same is-seeking to-be-being in to{all-say-ia}. If you-are-doing the-same, reveal yourself to{the world},"
\v 5 for neither the brothers of{same} have-been-believing/entrusting into same.
\v 6 So, the Jesus is-saying to{same}, "The season, the mine, not-yet is-being-beside/present; moreover, the season, the yours, always is-being ready.
\v 7 The world is_not_being-enabled to-be-hating you; moreover, it-is-hating emphatically-me, that I am-witnessing about of{same}, that evil is-being the works of{same}.
\v 8 You, ascend into the festival; I not-yet am-ascending into the festival, the-same, that the my season not-yet has-been-fulfilled."
\v 9 Moreover, say[ing] the-same to{same}, he-stays in to{the Galilee}.
\v 10 Moreover, as the brothers of{same} ascend, then also same ascends into the festival, not revealingly; contrariwise, as in to{hidden[adjective]}.
\v 11 So, the Judeans have-been-seeking same in to{the festival} and have-been-saying, "Where[?] is-being the-there[?],"
\v 12 and much murmuring/muttering/grumbling[noun] has-been-being about of{same} in to{the crowds}, the on-one-hand have-been-saying that he-is-being beneficial; on-the-other-hand, others have-been-saying, "Contrariwise, not. He-is-leading-astray the crowd."
\v 13 Nevertheless, not-one has-been-speaking to{all-say-ia} about of{same} through the fear of{the Judeans}.
\v 14 Moreover, already of{the festival being-midway}, the Jesus ascends into the consecrated[i.e. temple] and has-been-teaching.
\v 15 So, the Judeans have-been-marveling, saying, "How[?] the-same has-beheld write-effects, not having-learned[?]"
\v 16 The Jesus responds to{same} and says, "The my teaching is_not_being mine; contrariwise, of{the dispatch[ing]} me.
\v 17 If-supposing anyone may-be-will-ing to-be-doing the will-effect of{same}, he-will-know about of{the teaching}, whether it-is-being out of{the God} or I am-speaking from of{myself}.
\v 18 The speaking from of{sameself} is-seeking the esteem/glory, the own/self; moreover, the seeking same, the esteem/glory of{the dispatch[ing]}, the-same is-being true, and injustice in to{same} is_not_being.
\v 19 Not[?] Moses has-given to{you} the law[?], and not-one out of{you} is-doing the law. What[?] you-are-seeking me to-kill-off/away[?]"
\v 20 The crowd responds and says, "You-are-having demon. Who[?] is-seeking you to-kill-off/away[?]"
\v 21 Jesus responds and says to{same}, "I-do one work and all are-marveling.
\v 22 Through the-same, Moses has-given to{you} the circumcision, not that out of{the Moses} it-is-being; contrariwise, out of{the fathers}, and in to{[the] sabbath} you-are-circumcising [a] man,
\v 23 if [a] man is-taking circumcision in to{[the] sabbath}, in-which-place the law of{Moses} would_not_be-loosed, to{emphatically-me} you-are-being-galled that I-make [a] whole man healthy in to{[the] sabbath}.
\v 24 Be_not_judging according-to sight-sis[i.e. state of seeing/sight]; contrariwise, judge the just judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]."
\v 25 So, some out of{the Jerusalemites} have-been-saying, "Not[?] the-same is-being whom they-are-seeking to-kill-off/away[?],
\v 26 and, behold, to{all-say-ia} he-is-speaking, and they-are-saying nothing to{same}, not-whereby truly the chiefs know that the-same is-being the Anointed[?]
\v 27 Contrariwise, we-have-beheld the-same, whence he-is-being; moreover, the Anointed, when-supposing he-may-be-being-come, no-one is-knowing whence he-is-being."
\v 28 So, the Jesus cries-out, teaching in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} and saying, "You-have-beheld also-me and have-beheld whence I-am-being, and from of{myself} I-have_not_come; contrariwise, the dispatch[ing] me is-being genuine, whom you have_not_beheld.
\v 29 Moreover, I have-beheld same, that beside of{same} I-am-being, and-the-there sends-off/away me."
\v 30 So, they-have-been-seeking same to-grab-hold-of, and no-one upon-casts the hand upon same, that not-yet the hour of{same} had-come.
\v 31 Moreover, many out of{the crowd} believe/entrust into same and have-been-saying, "The Anointed, when-supposing he-may-come, will-do not many-more signs of{what} the-same does."
\v 32 The Pharisees hear the-same of{the crowd murmuring/muttering/grumbling} about of{same}, and the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the Pharisees send-off/away subordinates in-which-place they-may-grab-hold-of same.
\v 33 So, the Jesus says to{same}, "Still little time alongside of{you} I-am-being, and I-am-withdrawing toward the dispatch[ing] me.
\v 34 You-will-seek me and you-will_not_discover, and which-where I am-being you are_not_being-enabled to-come."
\v 35 So, the Judeans say toward sameselves, "Where[?] the-same is-being-about to-be-being-gone, that we will_not_discover same[?] Not into the sow-through/dispersion of{the Greeks} he-is-being-about to-be-being-gone and to-be-teaching the Greeks[?]
\v 36 What[?] is-being the-same, the word, which he-says, 'You-will-seek me and you-will_not_discover, and which-where I am-being you are_not_being-enabled to-come.'[?]"
\v 37 Moreover, in to{the last day, the great} of{the festival}, the Jesus had-stood and cries-out, saying, "If-supposing anyone may-be-thirsting: be-being-come toward me and be-drinking.
\v 38 The believing/entrusting into emphatically-me according-as the scripture says, rivers out of{the cavity-ia} of{same} will-flow of{being-alive water}."
\v 39 Moreover, the-same says about of{the Spirit, which} the believing/entrusting into same have-been-being-about to-be-taking, for not-yet [the] Holy Spirit has-been-being, that the Jesus not-moreover-yet-ly is-esteem-ized/glorified.
\v 40 So, many out of{the crowd}, hear[ing] the word, have-been-saying, "The-same truly is-being the prophet."
\v 41 Others have-been-saying, "The-same is-being the Anointed." Moreover, others have-been-saying, "For not out of{the Galilee} the Anointed is-being-come,
\v 42 emphatically-not. The scripture says that out of{the sow-effect} [of-]David, and from Bethlehem, of{the village} which-where David has-been-being, the Anointed is-being-come."
\v 43 So, [a] split-effect in to{the crowd} is-become through same.
\v 44 Moreover, some out of{same} have-been-will-ing to-grab-hold-of same; contrariwise, not-one upon-casts the hands upon same.
\v 45 So, the subordinates come toward the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and Pharisees, and they-say to{same}, the-there-s, "Through what[?] you-do_not_lead same[?]"
\v 46 The subordinates respond, "Not-yet-ever the-same-ly [a] man speaks as the-same, the man."
\v 47 So, the Pharisees respond to{same}, "No, also you have-been-led-astray[?]
\v 48 Not any out of{the chiefs} believes/entrusts into same, or out of{the Pharisees}.
\v 49 Contrariwise, the crowd, the-same, the not knowing the law are-being cursed-upon[adjective]."
\v 50 Nicodemus is-saying toward same, the come[ing] of{night} toward same, one being out of{same},
\v 51 "Not the law of{us} is-judging the man if-supposing it-may_not_hear first beside of{same} and may-know what he-is-doing[?]"
\v 52 They-respond and say to{same}, "Not also you are-being out of{the Galilee}[?] Investigate and behold that [a] prophet is_not_being-roused out of{the Galilee},"
\v 53 and each is-gone into the house of{same};
\c 8
\v 1 moreover, Jesus is-gone into the mountain of{the olives}.
\v 2 Moreover, of{daybreak} again he-becomes-aside into the consecrated[i.e. temple], and all the people has-been-being-come toward same and, sit[ing]-down, he-has-been-teaching same.
\v 3 Moreover, the scribes and the Pharisees are-leading[i.e. bringing] toward same [a] woman having-been-taken-down/against/according-to in to{adultery} and, stand[ing] same in to{midst},
\v 4 they-are-saying to{same}, "Teacher, same, the woman, is-taken-down/against/according-to upon to{same-detect-ly[adjective]} [i.e. caught red-handed, in the act] adultering.
\v 5 Moreover, in to{the law}, Moses commands to{us} the to-whom-the-same to-be-being-stone-cast. So, you, what[?] you-are-saying about of{same}[?]"
\v 6 Moreover, they-have-been-saying the-same, trial-izing same, in-which-place they-may-be-having to-be-accusing down/against of{same}. Moreover, the Jesus, stoop[ing] down, has-been-writing to{the finger} into the ground, not being-toward-made/done [i.e. acting as if not so].
\v 7 Moreover, as they-have-been-remaining-upon asking same, stoop[ing]-up/anew, he-says toward same, "The without-sin of{you} first: cast the stone upon same[feminine],
\v 8 and, again stoop[ing] down, he-has-been-writing into the ground.
\v 9 Moreover, the hear[ing] under of{the behold-together-sis[i.e. state of beholding together]/conscience}, being-confuted, have-been-being-come-out one according-to one, initiate[ing] from of{the elders} until of{the lasts}, and only the Jesus is-left-behind, and the woman being in to{midst}.
\v 10 Moreover, stoop[ing]-up/anew, the Jesus, and spectate[ing] no-one more-ly of{the woman}, says to{same}, "Woman, where[?] are-being the-there-s, the accusers of{you}[?] Not-one judges-against you[?]"
\v 11 Moreover, the says, "Not-one, Lord." Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "Neither I am-judging-against you. Be-being-gone and from of{the} now no-still be-sinning."
\v 12 So, again, the Jesus speaks to{same}, saying, I am-being the light of{the world}. The accompanying to{emphatically-me} no, will_not_walk-around in to{the darkness-ia}; contrariwise, he-will-have the light of{the being-alive[noun]}.
\v 13 So, the Pharisees say to{same}, "You are-witnessing about of{yourself}. The witness-ia of{you} is_not_being true."
\v 14 Jesus responds and says to{same}, "And-supposing I may-be-witnessing about of{myself}, the witness-ia of{me} is-being true, that I-have-beheld whence I-come and where I-am-withdrawing; moreover, you have_not_beheld whence I-am-being-come or where I-am-withdrawing.
\v 15 You are-judging according-to the flesh; I am_not_judging, not-one,
\v 16 and if-supposing, moreover, I may-be-judging, the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment], the mine, is-being true, that I-am_not_being alone; contrariwise, I and the Father dispatch[ing] me,
\v 17 and in to{the law}, moreover, to{the yours}, it-has-been-written that the witness-ia of{two men} is-being true.
\v 18 I am-being the witnessing about of{myself} and the Father dispatch[ing] me is-witnessing about of{emphatically-me}."
\v 19 So, they-have-been-saying to{same}, "Where[?] is-being the father of{you}[?]" Jesus responds, "Neither you-have-beheld emphatically-me nor the Father of{me}. If supposing you-had-beheld emphatically-me, also you-had-beheld the Father of{me}."
\v 20 He-speaks the-same, the say-effects/statements, in to{the treasury}, teaching in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, and not-one grabs-hold-of same, that the hour of{same} not-yet had-come.
\v 21 So, the Jesus says again to{same}, "I am-withdrawing, and you-will-seek me, and you-will-die-selves-off/away in to{the sin} of{you}; which-where I am-withdrawing you are_not_being-enabled to-come."
\v 22 So, the Judeans have-been-saying, "Not-what[?] he-will-kill-off/away sameself, that he-is-saying, 'Which-where I am-withdrawing you are_not_being-enabled to-come.'[?],"
\v 23 and he-says to{same}, "You are-being out of{the down}; I am-being out of{the up}. You are-being out of{the world, the-same}; I am_not_being out of{the world, the-same}.
\v 24 So, I-say to{you} that you-will-die-selves-off/away in to{the sins} of{you}, for if-supposing you-would_not_believe that I am-being, you-will-die-selves-off/away in to{the sins} of{you}."
\v 25 So, they-have-been-saying to{same}, "You, who[?] you-are-being[?]" The Jesus says to{same}, "The what also I-am-speaking to{you}, the origin."
\v 26 I-am-having many to-be-speaking about of{you}, and to-be-judging; contrariwise, the dispatch[ing] me is-being true, and-I, which I-hear beside of{same}, am-speaking the-same into the world."
\v 27 They-do_not_know that he-has-been-saying "the Father" to{same}.
\v 28 So, the Jesus says to{same}, "When-supposing you-may-elevate the son of{the man}, then you-will-know that I am-being, and from of{myself} I-am-doing nothing; contrariwise, according-as the Father teaches me, I-am-speaking the-same,
\v 29 and the dispatch[ing] me is-being alongside of{emphatically-me}. He-does_not_let-off/away me alone, that always I am-doing the pleasing[adjective] to{same}."
\v 30 Of{same speaking} the-same, many believe/entrust into same.
\v 31 So, the Jesus has-been-saying toward the Judeans having-believed/entrusted to{same}, "If-supposing you may-remain in to{the word, the mine}, you-are-being truly disciples of{me},
\v 32 and you-will-know the truth and the truth will-emancipate/liberate/release/free you."
\v 33 They-respond toward same, "We-are-being [the] sow-effect [of-]Abraham and to{not-one} we-have-been-enslaved ever-yet. How[?] you are-saying that 'you-will-become emancipated/liberated/released/free[adjective][?]'"
\v 34 The Jesus responds to{same}, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that every, the doing the sin, is-being [a] slave of{the sin}.
\v 35 Moreover, the slave is_not_remaining in to{the home} into the eon; the Son is-remaining into the eon.
\v 36 So, if-supposing the Son may-emancipate/liberate/release/free you, being-ly/actually you-will-be emancipated/liberated/released/free[adjective].
\v 37 I-have-beheld that you-are-being [the] sow-effect [of-]Abraham; contrariwise, you-are-seeking me to-kill-off/away, that the word, the mine, is_not_making-space in to{you}.
\v 38 What I have-seen beside to{the Father} of{me} I-am-speaking and, so, what you have-seen beside to{the Father} of{you} you-are-doing."
\v 39 They-respond and say to{same}, "The father of{us} is-being Abraham." The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "If supposing offsprings of{the} Abraham you-have-been-being, you-have-been-doing the works of{the} Abraham.
\v 40 Moreover, now you-are-seeking me to-kill-off/away, [a] man who has-spoken the truth to{you}, which I-hear beside of{the God}. Abraham does_not_do the-same.
\v 41 You are-doing the works of{the father} of{you}." So, they-say to{same}, "We have_not_been-begotten out of{sexual-immorality}. We-are-having one Father, the God."
\v 42 So, the Jesus says to{same}, "If supposing the God has-been-being Father of{you}, you-have-been-loving emphatically-me, for I come-out out of{the God} and am-arriving, for neither from of{myself} I-have-come; contrariwise, the-there sends-off/away me.
\v 43 Through what[?] you-are_not_knowing the speech, the mine, that you-are_not_being-enabled to-be-hearing the word, the mine[?]
\v 44 You are-being out of{the father, the devil/slanderous} and you-are-will-ing to-be-doing the desire-upon-ias of{the father} of{you}. The-there has-been-being homicidal from of{origin} and in to{the truth} has_not_been-standing, that truth is_not_being in to{same}. When-supposing he-may-be-speaking the falsehood, he-is-speaking out of{the[plural] own}, that he-is-being [a] falsifier/liar, and the father of{same}.
\v 45 Moreover, I, that I-am-saying the truth, you-are_not_believing/entrusting to{me}.
\v 46 Who[?] out of{you} is-confuting me about of{sin}[?] If I-am-saying truth, through what[?] you are_not_believing/entrusting to{me}[?]
\v 47 The being out of{the God} is-hearing the say-effects/statements of{the God}. Through the-same, you are_not_hearing, that you-are_not_being out of{the God}."
\v 48 So, the Judeans respond and say to{same}, "Not well we are-saying that you are-being [a] Samaritan and are-having demon[?]"
\v 49 Jesus responds, "I am_not_having demon; contrariwise, I-am-valuing the Father of{me} and you are-un-value-izing me.
\v 50 Moreover, I am_not_seeking the esteem/glory of{me}. He-is-being the seeking and judging.
\v 51 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, if-supposing anyone may-keep the word, the mine, no, he-should_not_observe death into the eon."
\v 52 So, the Judeans say to{same}, "Now we-have-known that you-are-having demon. Abraham dies-off/away, and the prophets, and you are-saying, 'If-supposing anyone may-keep the word of{me}, no, he-will_not_taste of{death} into the eon.'
\v 53 You are-being not greater of{the father} of{us}, Abraham, the-who dies-off/away, and the prophets die-off/away. Whom[?] yourself you-are-making[?]"
\v 54 Jesus responds, "If-supposing I am-esteem-izing/glorifying myself, the esteem/glory of{me} is-being nothing. The Father of{me} is-being the esteem-izing/glorifying me, whom you are-saying that he-is-being God of{us},
\v 55 and you-have_not_known same; moreover, I have-beheld same, and if-supposing I-may-say that I-have_not_beheld same, I-will-be [a] falsifier/liar similar of{you}; contrariwise, I-have-beheld same and I-am-keeping the word of{same}.
\v 56 Abraham, the father of{you}, exults-self in-which-place he-may-behold the day, the mine, and he-beholds and is-joyed."
\v 57 So, the Judeans say toward same, "Not-yet you-are-having fifty years and you-have-seen Abraham[?]"
\v 58 The Jesus says to{same}, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, prior Abraham to-become, I am-being."
\v 59 So, they-lift stones in-which-place they-may-cast upon same; moreover, Jesus is-hidden, and comes-out out of{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, come[ing]-through through of{midst} of{same}, and has-been-leading-aside the-same-ly,
\c 9
\v 1 and, leading-aside, he-beholds [a] man blind out of{birth},
\v 2 and the disciples of{same} ask same, saying, "Rabbi, who[?] sins, the-same or the parents of{same}, in-which-place blind he-would-be-begotten[?]"
\v 3 Jesus responds, "Neither the-same sins nor the parents of{same}; contrariwise, in-which-place the works of{the God} may-be-revealed in to{same},
\v 4 it-is-necessitating emphatically-me to-be-work-izing-self the works of{the dispatch[ing]} me while day is-being. Night is-being-come when not-one is-being-enabled to-be-work-izing-self.
\v 5 When-supposing I-may-be-being in to{the world}, I-am-being light of{the world}."
\v 6 Say[ing] the-same, he-spits on-the-ground[adverb] and makes mud/clay out of{the spit-effect} and anoints-upon of{same} the mud/clay upon the eyes of{the blind}
\v 7 and says to{same}, "Be-withdrawing. Wash into the pool of{the Siloam}," which is-being-meant, "having-been-sent-off/away." So, he-comes-off/away and washes, and he-comes viewing.
\v 8 So, the neighbors and the observing same the more-before, that he-has-been-being blind, have-been-saying, "Not the-same is-being the being-seated and giving-cause/requesting-toward[?]"
\v 9 Others have-been-saying that "he-is-being the-same;" moreover, others, that "emphatically-not, contrariwise, he-is-being similar to{same}." Moreover, the-there has-been-saying that "I am-being."
\v 10 So, they-have-been-saying to{same}, "How[?] the eyes of{you} are-opened-up[?]"
\v 11 The-there responds and says, "[A] man being-said 'Jesus' makes mud/clay and anoints-upon the eyes of{me} and says to{me}, 'Be-withdrawing into the pool of{the Siloam}" and wash.' So, come[ing]-off/away and wash[ing], I-view-anew."
\v 12 So, they-say to{same}, "Where[?] he-is-being[?]" The-there is-saying, "I-have_not_beheld."
\v 13 They-are-leading same, the at-what-time blind, toward the Pharisees.
\v 14 Moreover, it-has-been-being [the] sabbath when the Jesus makes the mud/clay and opens-up the eyes of{same}.
\v 15 So, again, the Pharisees have-been-asking same also how[?] he-views-anew. Moreover, the says to{same}, "He-upon-places mud/clay upon the eyes of{me} and I-wash and I-am-viewing."
\v 16 So, some out of{the Pharisees} have-been-saying, "The-same, the man, is_not_being beside of{God}, that he-is_not_keeping the sabbath." Others have-been-saying, "How[?] sinful man is-being-enabled to-which-the-same signs to-be-doing[?]" and [a] split-effect has-been-being in to{same}.
\v 17 They-are-saying to{the blind} again, "You, what[?] you-are-saying about of{same}, that he-opens-up the eyes of{you}[?]" Moreover, the says that he-is-being [a] prophet.
\v 18 So, the Judeans do_not_believe about of{same}, that he-has-been-being blind and views-anew, until of{when} they-sound the parents of{same, the view[ing]-anew},
\v 19 and they-ask same, saying, "The-same is-being the son of{you}, whom you are-saying that he-is-begotten blind[?] So, how[?] presently he-is-viewing[?]"
\v 20 Moreover, the parents of{same} respond to{same} and say, "We-have-beheld that the-same is-being the son of{us} and that he-is-begotten blind;
\v 21 moreover, how now he-is-viewing we-have_not_beheld or what opens-up the eyes of{same} we have_not_beheld. Same is-having age/stature; ask same. Same will-speak about of{sameself}."
\v 22 The parents of{same} say the-same, that they-have-been-fearing the Judeans, for already the Judeans had-together-placed in-which-place if-supposing any may-acknowledge same Anointed he-would-become off/away-from-gathering[translit. "synagogue"]-ible[adjective].
\v 23 Through the-same the parents of{same} say that "he-is-having age/stature; ask same."
\v 24 So, they-sound out of{second [instance]} the man who has-been-being blind and say to{same}, "Give esteem/glory to{the God}. We have-beheld that the man, the-same, is-being sinful."
\v 25 So, the-there responds, "If he-is-being sinful I-have_not_beheld. I-have-beheld one, that, being blind, presently I-am-viewing."
\v 26 So, they-say to{same} again, "What[?] he-does to{you}[?] How[?] he-opens-up the eyes of{you}[?]"
\v 27 He-responds to{same}, "I-say to{you} already and you-do_not_hear. What[?] again you-are-will-ing to-be-hearing[?] Not also you are-will-ing to-become disciples of{same}[?]"
\v 28 Moreover, the[plural] insult same and say, "You are-being [a] disciple of{the-there}; moreover, we are-being disciples of{the Moses}.
\v 29 We have-beheld that to{Moses} the God has-spoken; moreover, we-have_not_beheld the-same, whence he-is-being."
\v 30 The man responds and says to{same}, "For in to{the-same} is-being marvelous, that you have_not_beheld whence he-is-being and he-opens-up the eyes of{me}.
\v 31 Moreover, we-have-beheld that the God is_not_hearing of{sinful}; contrariwise, if-supposing any may-be-being God-reverent and may-be-doing the will-effect of{same}, he-is-hearing of{the-same}.
\v 32 Out of{the eon} it-is_not_heard that someone opens-up [the] eyes of{having-been-begotten blind}.
\v 33 If the-same has_not_been-being beside of{God} he-has_not_been-being-enabled to-be-doing, nothing."
\v 34 They-respond and say to{same}, "In to{sins} you, whole, are-begotten and you are-teaching us[?]," and they-cast-out same outside.
\v 35 The Jesus hears that they-cast-out same outside and, discover[ing] same, he-says to{same}, "You are-believing/entrusting into the Son of{the God}[?]"
\v 36 The-there responds and says, "And who[?] is-being, Lord, in-which-place I-may-believe/entrust into same[?]"
\v 37 Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, "Also, you-have-seen same, and the speaking alongside of{you} is-being the-there."
\v 38 Moreover, the has-been-asserting, "I-am-believing, Lord," and worships to{same},
\v 39 and the Jesus says, "Into judge-effect/judgment I come into the world, the-same, in-which-place the not viewing may-be-viewing and the viewing may-become blind,"
\v 40 and the being out of{the Pharisees} hear the-same alongside of{same} and say to{same}, "No, also we are-being blind[?]"
\v 41 The Jesus says to{same}, "If supposing you-have-been-being blind, you-have_not_been-having sin; moreover, now you-are-saying that 'We-are-viewing,' so, the sin of{you} is-remaining."
\c 10
\v 1 "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, the not being-come-into through of{the entrance} into the courtyard of{the sheep}; contrariwise, ascending from-another-place, the-there is-being [a] thief and [a] robber.
\v 2 Moreover, the being-come-into through of{the entrance} is-being shepherd of{the sheep}.
\v 3 To{the-same} the doorkeeper is-opening-up and the sheep[plural], it-is-hearing of{the sound} of{same} and he-is-sounding the own sheep according-to name and is-leading-out same.
\v 4 When-supposing he-may-cast-out the own sheep he-is-being-gone in-front of{same} and the sheep[plural], it-is-accompanying to{same}, that they-have-beheld the sound of{same}.
\v 5 Moreover, to{belonging-to-another} no, they-would_not_accompany; contrariwise, they-will-flee/be-fled away-from of{same}, that they-have_not_beheld the sound of{the belonging-to-others}."
\v 6 The Jesus says the-same, the proverb, to{same}; moreover, the-there-s do_not_know what has-been-being which he-has-been-speaking to{same}.
\v 7 So, again the Jesus says to{same}, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that I am-being the entrance of{the sheep}.
\v 8 All as-many-as come before of{emphatically-me} are-being thieves and robbers; contrariwise, the sheep do_not_hear of{same}.
\v 9 I am-being the entrance. Through of{emphatically-me} if-supposing who may-come-into will-be-saved, and will-be-come-into and will-be-come-out and will-discover pasturage.
\v 10 The thief is_not_being-come if not in-which-place he-may-steal and he-may-sacrifice[by consequence, kill] and he-may-destroy-off/away. I come in-which-place they-may-be-having being-alive[noun] and they-may-be-having excess.
\v 11 I am-being the shepherd, the good. The shepherd, the good, is-placing the life of{same} over/for-the-sake of{the sheep}.
\v 12 Moreover, the hired[noun], also not being shepherd, of{whom} the sheep are_not_being own, is-observing the wolf being-come, and is-letting-off/away the sheep and is-fleeing, and the wolf is-snatching same and is-scattering the sheep.
\v 13 Moreover, the hired[noun] is-fleeing, that he-is-being [a] hired[noun], and he-is_not_concerning/caring to{same} about of{the sheep}.
\v 14 I am-being the shepherd, the good, and I-am-knowing the mine and am-being-known under of{the mine},
\v 15 according-as the Father is-knowing me and-I am-knowing the Father, and I-am-placing the life of{me} over/for-the-sake of{the sheep},
\v 16 and I-am-having other sheep which is_not_being out of{the courtyard, the-same}, and-the-there it-is-necessitating me to-lead, and of{the sound} of{me} they-will-hear, and they-will-become one shepherded[flock], one shepherd.
\v 17 Through the-same the Father is-loving me, that I am-placing the life of{me} in-which-place again I-may-take same.
\v 18 No-one is-lifting same from of{emphatically-me}; contrariwise, I am-placing same from of{myself}. I-am-having authority to-place same and I-am-having authority again to-take same, the-same, the command, I-take beside of{the Father} of{me}."
\v 19 So, [a] split-effect again becomes in to{the Judeans} through the words, the-same.
\v 20 Moreover, many out of{same[plural]} have-been-saying, "He-is-having demon and is-raging/being-mad. What[?] you-are-hearing of{same}[?]"
\v 21 Others have-been-saying, "The-same, the say-effects/statements, is_not_being of{being-demonized}. No demon is-being-enabled/empowered to-open-up eyes of{[the] blind}."
\v 22 Moreover, the dedications/consecrations in to{Jerusalems} is-become. It-has-been-being bad-weather/storm/winter,
\v 23 and the Jesus has-been-walking-around in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} in to{the portico/colonnade} of{Solomon}.
\v 24 So, the Judeans circle same and have-been-saying to{same}, "Until at-what-time[?] you-are-lifting the life of{us} [i.e. keeping their lives in suspense][?] If you are-being the Anointed, say to{us} to{all-say-ia}."
\v 25 The Jesus responds to{same}, "I-say to{you} and you-are_not_believing. The works which I am-doing in to{the name} of{the Father} of{me}, the-same, is-witnessing about of{emphatically-me}.
\v 26 Contrariwise, you are_not_believing, that you-are_not_being out of{the sheep, the mine}, according-as I-say to{you}.
\v 27 The sheep[plural], the mine, it-is-hearing of{the sound} of{me}, and-I am-knowing same and they-are-accompanying to{me},
\v 28 and-I am-giving to{same} eternal being-alive[noun], and no, they-would_not_perish-off/away into the eon, and any will_not_snatch same out of{the hand} of{me}.
\v 29 The Father of{me} who has-given to{me} is-being greater-than of{all} and not-one is-being-enabled to-be-snatching out of{the hand} of{the Father} of{me}.
\v 30 I and the Father are-being one."
\v 31 So, again the Judeans bear[weight] stones in-which-place they-may-stone-ize same.
\v 32 The Jesus responds to{same}, "I-show many good works to{you} out of{the Father} of{me}. Through about-what-such[?] work of{same[neuter plural]} you-are-stone-izing me[?]"
\v 33 The Judeans respond to{same}, "About of{good work} we-are_not_stone-izing you; contrariwise, about of{evil-assertion-ia}, and that you, being [a] man, are-making yourself God."
\v 34 The Jesus responds to{same}, "Not[?] it-is-being having-been-written in to{the law} of{you} that 'I say you-are-being gods'[?]
\v 35 If he-says the-there-s 'gods,' toward whom the word of{the God} is-become, and the scripture is_not_being-enabled to-be-loosed,
\v 36 whom[singular] the Father holy-izes and sends-off/away into the world, you are-saying that 'you-are-asserting-evil' that I-say I-am-being Son of{the God}.
\v 37 If I-am_not_doing the works of{the Father} of{me} do_not_be-believing/entrusting to{me};
\v 38 moreover, if I-am-doing, also-supposing to{emphatically-me} you-may_not_be-believing, believe to{the works}, in-which-place you-may-know and may-believe that in to{emphatically-me} the Father, and-I in to{same}."
\v 39 So, they-have-been-seeking again to-grab-hold-of same, and he-comes-out out of{the hand} of{same},
\v 40 and he-comes-off/away again other-side of{the Jordan} into the place which-where John has-been-being the first immersing and stays there,
\v 41 and many come toward same and have-been-saying that John on-one-hand does not-one sign; on-the-other-hand, all, as-much-as John says about of{the-same}, has-been-being true,
\v 42 and many believe/entrust into same there.
\c 11
\v 1 Moreover, someone has-been-being being-infirm, Lazarus, from of{Bethany}, out of{the village} of{Mary} and of{Martha, the sister} of{same[feminine]}.
\v 2 Moreover, Mary has-been-being the oil[ing] the Lord to{ointment} and out-wipe[ing] the feet of{same} to{the hairs} of{same[feminine], whom} the brother, Lazarus, has-been-being-infirm.
\v 3 So, the sisters send-off/away toward same, saying, "Lord, behold, whom you-are-being-fond-of is-being-infirm."
\v 4 Moreover, hear[ing], the Jesus says, "Same, the infirmity, is_not_being toward death; contrariwise, over/for-the-sake of{the esteem/glory} of{the God}, in-which-place the Son of{the God} may-be-esteem-ized/glorified through of{same}."
\v 5 Moreover, the Jesus has-been-loving the Martha, and the sister of{same}, and the Lazarus.
\v 6 So, as he-hears that he-is-being-infirm, then, on-one-hand, he-stays to{place}, in to{which} he-has-been-being, two days.
\v 7 [On the other hand,] upon-thereafter, alongside the-same[neuter singular], he-is-saying to{the disciples}, "We-should-be-leading into the Judea again."
\v 8 The disciples are-saying to{same}, "Rabbi, now the Judeans have-been-seeking you to-stone-ize, and again you-are-withdrawing there[?]"
\v 9 Jesus responds, "Emphatically-not[?] twelve hours are-being of{the day}[?] If-supposing any may-be-walking-around in to{the day}, he-is_not_striking-toward[i.e. tripping], that he-is-viewing the light of{the world, the-same}.
\v 10 Moreover, if-supposing any may-be-walking-around in to{the night}, he-is-striking-toward[i.e. tripping], that the light is_not_being in to{same}.
\v 11 He-says the-same[plural], and alongside the-same[singular], he-is-saying to{same}, "Lazarus, the friend of{us}, has-slept; contrariwise, I-am-being-gone in-which-place I-may-out-sleep-ize/awaken same."
\v 12 So, the disciples of{same} say, "Lord, if he-has-slept he-will-be-saved."
\v 13 Moreover, the Jesus had-said about of{the death} of{same}; moreover, the-there-s esteem that he-is-saying about of{the sleep-sis[i.e. state of sleeping]} of{the sleep}.
\v 14 So, then the Jesus says to{same} to{all-say-ia}, "Lazarus dies-off/away,
\v 15 and I-am-joying through you, in-which-place you-may-believe that I-have_not_been-being there; contrariwise, we-should-be-leading toward same."
\v 16 So, Thomas, the being-said "Didymus," says to{the together-disciples}, "We also should-be-leading in-which-place we-may-die-off/away alongside of{same}."
\v 17 So, the Jesus, come[ing], discovers same, already four days having in to{the memorial}.
\v 18 Moreover, the Bethany has-been-being near of{the Jerusalems}, as from of{fifteen stadia}.
\v 19 Moreover, many out of{the Judeans} had-come toward the[plural] about Martha and Mary, in-which-place they-may-relate-beside same about of{the brother} of{same}.
\v 20 So, the Martha, as she-hears that Jesus is-being-come, encounters to{same}; moreover, Mary has-been-being-seat-ized in to{the house}.
\v 21 So, the Martha says toward the Jesus, "Lord, if you-have-been-being here, the brother of{me} not supposing dies-off/away."
\v 22 Contrariwise, also now I-have-beheld that as-much-as supposing you-may-give-cause/request the God, the God will-give to{you}.
\v 23 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "The brother of{you} will-stand-up/anew."
\v 24 Martha is-saying to{same}, "I-have-beheld that he-will-stand-up/anew in to{the stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection]} in to{the last day}."
\v 25 The Jesus says to{same}, I am-being the stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection] and the being-alive[noun]. The believing/entrusting into emphatically-me, and-supposing he-may-die-off/away, he-will-be-alive,
\v 26 and every, the being-alive and believing/entrusting into emphatically-me, no, he-would_not_die-off/away into the eon. You-are-believing the-same[?]"
\v 27 She-is-saying to{same}, "Yes, Lord, I have-believed that you are-being the Anointed, the Son of{the God}, the being-come into the world,"
\v 28 and, say[ing] the-same, she-comes-off/away, and she-sounds Mary, the sister of{same} privately, say[ing], "The teacher is-being-present and is-sounding you."
\v 29 Moreover, as the-there hears, she-is-being-roused speedily and is-being-come toward same.
\v 30 Moreover, not-yet the Jesus had-come into the village; contrariwise, he-has-been-being in to{the place} which-where the Martha encounters to{same}.
\v 31 So, the Judeans, the being alongside of{same} in to{the home} and relating-beside same, behold[ing] the Mary, that speedily she-stands-up/anew and comes-out, accompany same, saying that she-is-withdrawing into the memorial, in-which-place she-may-weep there.
\v 32 So, the Mary, as she-comes which-where the Jesus has-been-being, behold[ing] same, falls toward the feet of{same}, saying to{same}, "Lord, if you-have-been-being here, the brother of{me} not supposing dies-off/away."
\v 33 So, as Jesus beholds same weeping and the be[ing]-come-together to{same} Judeans weeping, he-expresses-emotion to{the Spirit} and disturbs sameself,
\v 34 and he-says, "Where[?] you-have-placed same[?]" They-are-saying to{same}, "Lord, be-being-come and behold."
\v 35 The Jesus tears.
\v 36 So, the Judeans have-been-saying, "Behold how he-has-been-being-fond-of same."
\v 37 Moreover, some out of{same} say, "He-has_not_been-being-enabled, the-same, the open[ing]-up the eyes of{the blind}, to-do in-which-place also the-same would_not_die-off/away."
\v 38 So, Jesus, again expressing-emotion in to{sameself}, is-being-come into the memorial. Moreover, it-has-been-being [a] cave, and [a] stone has-been-being-lain-upon upon to{same}.
\v 39 The Jesus is-saying, "Lift the stone." Martha, the sister of{the having-deceased}, is-saying to{same}, "Lord, already it-is-smelling, for it-is-being [the] fourth-day."
\v 40 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Not[?] I-say to{you} that if-supposing you-would-believe, you-will-see the esteem/glory of{the God}[?]"
\v 41 So, they-lift the stone, of{which} has-been-being the having-died being-lain. Moreover, the Jesus lifts the eyes up and says, "Father, I-am-well-favoring/giving-thanks to{you} that you-hear of{me}.
\v 42 Moreover, I had-beheld that always of{me} you-are-hearing; contrariwise, through the crowd, the having-stood-around, I-say, in-which-place they-may-believe that you send-off/away me,"
\v 43 and, say[ing] the-same, he-cry-out-izes to{large sound}, "Lazarus, Come! out,"
\v 44 and the having-died comes-out, having-been-bound, the feet and the hands had-been-bound-around to{girths/bandages} and the sight-sis[i.e. state of seeing/sight] of{same} to{sudarium[Latin]/towel/napkin/cloth}. The Jesus is-saying to{same} "Loose same and let-off/away to-be-withdrawing."
\v 45 So, many out of{the Judeans}, the come[ing] toward the Mary and spectate[ing] what the Jesus does, believe/entrust into same.
\v 46 Moreover, some out of{same} come-off/away toward the Pharisees and say to{same} what the Jesus does.
\v 47 So, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the Pharisees gather council and have-been-saying, "What[?] we-are-doing, that the-same, the man, is-doing many signs[?]
\v 48 If-supposing we-should-let-off/away same, the-same-ly all will-believe/entrust into same and the Romans will-be-come and will-lift of{us} and/also the place and the nation."
\v 49 Moreover, one who, out of{same}, Caiaphas, chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest], being of{the same-year, the-there}, says to{same}, "You have_not_beheld, nothing/not-one.
\v 50 Nor you-are-word-izing/reckoning/accounting-selves that it-is-carrying/bearing-together to{us} in-which-place one man would-die-off/away over/for-the-sake of{the people} and not the whole nation would-perish-off/away."
\v 51 Moreover, he-does_not_say the-same from of{sameself}; contrariwise, being chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] of{the same-year, the-there} he-prophesies that the Jesus has-been-being-about to-be-dying-off/away over/for-the-sake of{the nation},
\v 52 and not over/for-the-sake of{the nation} only; contrariwise, in-which-place also the offsprings of{the God}, the having-been-scattered-through, would-gather into one.
\v 53 So, from of{the-there, the day,} they-together-intend in-which-place they-may-be-killing-off/away same.
\v 54 So, Jesus has_not-still_been-walking-around to{all-say-ia} in to{the Judeans}; contrariwise, he-comes-off/away from-there into the region near of{the desolate} into Ephraim, being-said city, and-there has-been-engaging alongside of{the disciples} of{same}.
\v 55 Moreover, the passover of{the Judeans} has-been-being near, and many ascend into Jerusalem out of{the region} before of{the} passover in-which-place they-may-purify sameselves.
\v 56 So, they-have-been-seeking the Jesus and have-been-saying, having-stood alongside of{one-another} in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, "What[?] is-esteeming to{you}, that, no, he-would_not_come into the festival[?]"
\v 57 Moreover, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the Pharisees had-given [a] command in-which-place if-supposing any would-know where he-is-being, he-should-disclose which-how they-may-grab-hold-of same.
\c 12
\v 1 So, the Jesus, before six of{days} of{the} passover, comes into Bethany, which-where has-been-being Lazarus, the having-died whom he-rouses out of{dead}.
\v 2 So, they-make to{same} [a] dinner/supper there and the Martha has-been-serving. Moreover, the Lazarus has-been-being one of{the being-lain-up/anew} together-with to{same}.
\v 3 So, the Mary, take[ing] [a] litra[Latin "libra"] of{ointment} of{much-valuable, faithful/trustworthy spikenard}, oils the feet of{the Jesus} and wipes to{the hairs} of{same} the feet of{same}. Moreover, the home is-filled-full out of{the smell} of{the ointment}.
\v 4 So, one out of{the disciples} of{same}, Judas of{Simon} Iscariot, the being-about to-be-giving-aside/delivering same, is-saying,
\v 5 "Through what[?], the-same, the ointment, is_not_liquidated-for-sale of{three-hundred denarii} and is-given to{destitute}[?]"
\v 6 Moreover, he-says the-same not that about of{the destitute} he-has-been-concerning/caring to{same}; contrariwise, that he-has-been-being [a] thief, and has-been-having the tongue-case[i.e. small box], and has-been-bearing[weight] the being-cast [into it].
\v 7 So, the Jesus says, "Let-off/away-from same[feminine], in-which-place she-may-keep same into the day of{the en-burial-ization} of{me},
\v 8 for always you-are-having the destitute alongside of{sameselves}; moreover, you-are_not_having emphatically-me always."
\v 9 So, [a] vast crowd out of{the Judeans} knows that he-is-being there and they-come not through the Jesus only; contrariwise, in-which-place also they-may-behold the Lazarus, whom he-rouses out of{dead}.
\v 10 Moreover, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] intend in-which-place also they-may-be-killing-off/away the Lazarus,
\v 11 that through same many of{the Judeans} have-been-withdrawing and have-been-believing/entrusting into the Jesus.
\v 12 To{the} upon-the-next-day [a] vast crowd, the come[ing] into the festival, hear[ing] that Jesus is-being-come into Jerusalem,
\v 13 take the palm-leaf-branches of{the palm-trees} and come-out into encounter to{same}, and have-been-crying-out, "Hosanna, having-been-good-word-ed, the being-come in to{[the] name} of{[the] Lord}, king of{the} Israel."
\v 14 Moreover, the Jesus, discover[ing] [a] donkey-ling[diminutive], sits-down upon same according-as it-is-being having-been-written,
\v 15 "Do_not_be-fearing, daughter [of-]Zion. Behold, the king of{you} is-being-come, being-seated upon [a] colt of{[a] donkey}."
\v 16 Moreover, the disciples of{same} do_not_know the-same, the first; contrariwise, when the Jesus is-esteem-ized/glorified, then they-remember that the-same has-been-being upon to{same} having-been-written, and [that] they-do the-same to{same}.
\v 17 So, the crowd, the being alongside of{same} when he-sounds the Lazarus out of{the memorial} and rouses same out of{dead}, has-been-witnessing.
\v 18 Through the-same[neuter] also the crowd encounters to{same[masculine]}, that it-hears the-same[neuter], same[masculine] to-have-done the sign.
\v 19 So, the Pharisees say toward sameselves, "You-are-observing that you-are_not_profiting, not-one. Behold, the world comes-off/away behind of{same}."
\v 20 Moreover, some Greeks have-been-being out of{the ascending}, in-which-place they-may-worship in to{the festival}.
\v 21 So, the-same come-toward to{Philip, the} from Bethsaida of{the Galilee}, and have-been-asking same, saying, "Lord, we-are-will-ing to-behold the Jesus."
\v 22 Philip is-being-come and is-saying to{the Andrew}, and again Andrew and Philip are-saying to{the Jesus}.
\v 23 Moreover, the Jesus responds to{same}, saying, "The hour has-come in-which-place the son of{the man} may-be-esteem-ized/glorified.
\v 24 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, if-supposing not the kernel of{the grain} fall[ing] into the ground may-die-off/away, same alone is-remaining; moreover, if-supposing it-may-die-off/away, it-is-carrying much fruit.
\v 25 The being-fond-of the life of{same} will-destroy-off/away same, and the hating the life of{same} in to{the world, the-same}, will-guard same into eternal being-alive[noun].
\v 26 If-supposing to{emphatically-me} any may-be-serving: be-accompanying to{emphatically-me}, and which-where I am-being, there also the servant, the mine, will-be, and if-supposing any may-be-serving to{emphatically-me} the Father will-value same.
\v 27 Now the life of{me} has-been-disturbed, and what[?] I-may-say, 'Father, save me out of{the hour, the-same}[?]' Contrariwise, through the-same I-come into the hour, the-same.
\v 28 Father, esteem-ize/glorify the name of{you}." So, [a] sound comes out of{the heaven} also, "I-esteem-ize/glorify and again I-will-esteem-ize/glorify."
\v 29 So, the crowd, the having-stood and hear[ing], has-been-saying to-have-become thunder; others have-been-saying [a] messenger has-spoken to{same}.
\v 30 Jesus responds and says, "Not through[i.e. on account of] emphatically-me same, the sound, has-become; contrariwise, through[i.e. on account of] you.
\v 31 Now is-being judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment] of{the world, the-same}. Now the chief of{the world, the-same} will-be-cast-out outside,
\v 32 and-I, if-supposing I-may-be-elevated out of{the earth}, I-will-pull all[masculine plural] toward myself."
\v 33 Moreover, he-has-been-saying the-same, signifying to{about-what-such death} he-has-been-being-about to-be-dying-off/away.
\v 34 The crowd responds to{same}, "We hear out of{the law} that the Anointed is-remaining into the eon, and how[?] you are-saying that it-is-necessitating to-be-elevated, the son of{the man}. Who[?] is-being the-same, the son of{the man}[?]"
\v 35 So, the Jesus says to{same}, "Still little time is-being the light alongside of{you}. Be-walking-around while you-are-having the light, in-which-place no darkness-ia may-take-down/against/according-to you and the walking-around in to{the darkness-ia} has_not_beheld where it-is-withdrawing.
\v 36 While you-are-having the light, be-believing/entrusting into the light, in-which-place you-may-become sons of{light}. The Jesus speaks the-same and, come[ing]-off/away, is-hidden from of{same}.
\v 37 Moreover, of{same having-done} the-which-the-same signs in-front of{same}, they-have_not_been-believing/entrusting into same,
\v 38 in-which-place the word of{Isaiah, the prophet} would-be-fulfilled, whom he-says, "Lord, who[?] believes/entrusts to{the heard[noun]} of{us} and the arm of{[the] Lord} to{whom[?]} it-is-off-covered/uncovered[?]"
\v 39 Through the-same they-have_not_been-being-enabled to-be-believing/entrusting, that again Isaiah says,
\v 40 "He-has-blinded the eyes of{same} and has-calloused the heart of{same}, in-which-place lest they-would-behold to{the eyes} and would-think to{the heart} and would-be-upon-turned and I-would-cure same."
\v 41 Isaiah says the-same when he-beholds the esteem/glory of{same}, and he-speaks about of{same}.
\v 42 Likewise, nevertheless, also out of{the chiefs} many believe/entrust into same; contrariwise, through[i.e. on account of] the Pharisees, they-have_not_been-same-word-ing/acknowledging, lest in-which-place they-would-become off/away-from-gathering[translit. "synagogue"]-ible[adjective],
\v 43 for they-love the esteem/glory of{the men} more than-about the esteem/glory of{the God}.
\v 44 Moreover, Jesus cries-out and says, "The believing/entrusting into emphatically-me is_not_believing/entrusting into emphatically-me; contrariwise, into the dispatch[ing] me,
\v 45 and the observing emphatically-me is-observing the dispatch[ing] me.
\v 46 I have-come [a] light into the world, in-which-place every, the believing/entrusting into emphatically-me, would_not_remain in to{the darkness-ia},
\v 47 and if-supposing any may-hear of{the say-effects/statements} of{me} and may_not_guard, I am_not_judging same, for I-do_not_come in-which-place I-may-be-judging the world; contrariwise, in-which-place I-may-save the world.
\v 48 The un-placing/rejecting emphatically-me and not taking the say-effects/statements of{me} is-having the judging same. The word whom I-speak, the-there, will-judge same in to{the last day},
\v 49 that I do_not_speak out of{myself}; contrariwise, the dispatch[ing] me, same Father gives to{me} command, what I-may-say and what I-may-speak,
\v 50 and I-have-beheld that the command of{same} is-being eternal being-alive[noun], so, what I am-speaking, according-as the Father has-said to{me}, the-same-ly I-am-speaking."
\c 13
\v 1 Moreover, before of{the festival} of{the} passover, the Jesus having-beheld that the hour of{same} comes in-which-place he-may-change-course/step-across/transition out of{the world, the-same} toward the Father, love[ing] the[plural] own, the[plural] in to{the world}, he-loves same[plural] into finish/completion,
\v 2 and of{dinner/supper become[ing]}, of{the devil/slanderous having-cast} already into the heart of{Judas Simon Iscariot} in-which-place he-may-give-aside/deliver same,
\v 3 the Jesus having-beheld that the Father has-given all to{same}, into the hands, and that from of{God} he-comes-out and toward the God is-withdrawing,
\v 4 he-is-being-roused out of{the dinner/supper} and is-placing the outer-garments and, take[ing] [a] towel[Latin "linteum"], through-girds sameself.
\v 5 Thereafter, he-is-casting water into the wash-basin and initiates to-be-washing the feet of{the disciples} and to-be-wiping-out to{the towel[Latin "linteum"], which} has-been-being having-been-through-girded.
\v 6 So, he-is-being-come toward Simon Peter, and the-there is-saying to{same}, "Lord, you are-washing the feet of{me}[?]"
\v 7 Jesus responds and says to{same}, "What I am-doing you have_not_beheld presently; moreover, you-will-know alongside the-same[plural]."
\v 8 Peter is-saying to{same}, "No, you-should_not_wash the feet of{me} into the eon." Jesus responds to{same}, "If-supposing I-should_not_wash you, you-are_not_having share/portion/part alongside of{emphatically-me}."
\v 9 Simon Peter is-saying to{same}, "Lord, not the feet of{me} only; contrariwise, also the hands and the head."
\v 10 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "The having-been-bathed is_not_having need than to-wash/be-washed the feet; contrariwise, he-is-being whole[ly] clean, and you[plural] are-being clean; contrariwise, emphatically-not all,"
\v 11 for he-had-beheld the giving-aside/delivering same; through the-same he-says, "Emphatically-not all are-being clean."
\v 12 So, when he-washes the feet of{same} and takes the outer-garments of{same}, fall[ing]-anew[i.e. sit down] again, he-says to{same}, "You-are-knowing what[?] I-have-done to{you}[?]
\v 13 You are-sounding me "The teacher" and "the Lord," and you-are-saying well, for I-am-being.
\v 14 So, if I wash the feet of{you}, "the Lord" and "the teacher," also you are-owing of{one-another} to-be-washing the feet,
\v 15 for I-give to{you} show-effect-under in-which-place according-as I do to{you} also you may-be-doing.
\v 16 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, [a] slave is_not_being greater-than of{the lord} of{same}, nor [a] sent-off[one] greater-than of{the dispatch[ing]} same.
\v 17 If you-have-beheld the-same[plural], you-are-being blessed if-supposing you-may-be-doing same[plural].
\v 18 Not about of{all} of{you} I-am-saying. I have-beheld whom I-choose; contrariwise, in-which-place the scripture may-be-fulfilled, "The munching the bread alongside of{emphatically-me} lifts-upon upon emphatically-me the heel of{same}."
\v 19 From presently I-am-saying to{you} before of{the} to-become, in-which-place when-supposing it-may-become, you-may-believe that I am-being.
\v 20 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, the taking if-supposing someone I-may-dispatch is-taking emphatically-me; moreover, the taking emphatically-me is-taking the dispatch[ing] me."
\v 21 The Jesus, say[ing] the-same, is-disturbed to{the Spirit}, and witnesses and says, "Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that one out of{you} will-give-aside/deliver me."
\v 22 So, the disciples have-been-viewing into one-another, being-perplexed about of{whom} he-is-saying.
\v 23 Moreover, one of{the disciples} of{same} has-been-being being-lain-up/anew in to{the bosom/lap} of{the Jesus}, whom the Jesus has-been-loving.
\v 24 So, Simon Peter is-nodding to{the-same} to-ascertain who[?] supposing might-be-being about of{whom} he-is-saying.
\v 25 So, the-there, fall[ing]-upon upon the chest/sternum of{the Jesus}, is-saying to{same}, "Lord, who[?] it-is-being[?]"
\v 26 The Jesus is-responding, "The-there is-being to{whom} I, dip[ing], the morsel, will-give-upon," and, dip[ing]-in, the morsel, he-is-giving to{Judas of{Simon} Iscariot},
\v 27 and alongside the morsel, then the Satan/adversary comes-into into the-there, so, the Jesus is-saying to{same}, "What you-are-doing do more-speedily."
\v 28 Moreover, not-one knows the-same, of{the being-lain-up/anew}, toward what he-says to{same},
\v 29 for some have-been-esteeming since the Judas has-been-having the tongue-case[i.e. small box], that the Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Purchase of{what} we-are-having need into the festival," or in-which-place what he-may-give to{the destitute}.
\v 30 So, take[ing] the morsel, the-there straightaway comes-out. Moreover, it-has-been-being night.
\v 31 So, when he-comes-out, the Jesus is-saying, "Now the son of{the man} is-esteem-ized/glorified, and the God is-esteem-ized/glorified in to{same}.
\v 32 If the God is-esteem-ized/glorified in to{same} also the God will-esteem-ize/glorify same in to{sameself} and straightaway will-esteem-ize/glorify same.
\v 33 Offspring-lings, still little alongside of{you} I-am-being. You-will-seek me and, according-as I-say to{the Judeans}, that which-where I am-withdrawing you are_not_being-enabled to-come, also to{you} I-am-saying presently.
\v 34 I-am-giving to{you} [a] new command in-which-place you-should-be-loving one-another according-as I-love you, in-which-place also you should-be-loving one-another.
\v 35 In to{the-same} all will-know that to{emphatically-me} you-are-being disciples, if-supposing you-may-be-having love in to{one-another}."
\v 36 Simon Peter is-saying to{same}, "Lord, where[?] you-are-withdrawing[?]" The Jesus responds to{same}, "Which-where I-am-withdrawing you-are_not_being-enabled now to-accompany to{me}; moreover, afterward you-will-accompany to{me}."
\v 37 Peter is-saying to{same}, "Lord, through what[?] I-am_not_being-enabled to-accompany to{you} presently[?] I-will-place the life of{me} over/for-the-sake of{you}.
\v 38 The Jesus responds to{same}, "You-will-place the life of{you} over/for-the-sake of{emphatically-me}. Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, no, [a] rooster will_not_sound until of{which} you-will-deny-off/away me thrice."
\c 14
\v 1 "The heart of{you[plural]}: be_not_be-being-disturbed. You-are-believing/entrusting into the God; also be-believing/entrusting into emphatically-me.
\v 2 Many abodes are-being in to{the home} of{the Father} of{me}. Moreover, if not I-say supposing to{you}, that I-am-being-gone to-prepare [a] place to{you},
\v 3 and if-supposing I-may-be-gone and may-prepare [a] place to{you}, again I-am-being-come and will-take-along you toward myself, in-which-place which-where I am-being also you may-be-being,
\v 4 and which-where I am-withdrawing you-have-beheld, and you-have-beheld the way."
\v 5 Thomas is-saying to{same}, "Lord, we-have_not_beheld where[?] you-are-withdrawing and how[?] we-are-being-enabled to-have-beheld the way[?]"
\v 6 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "I am-being the way and the truth and the being-alive[noun]. Not-one is-being-come toward the Father if not through of{emphatically-me}.
\v 7 If supposing you-had-known me, also the Father of{me} you-had-known, and from presently you-are-knowing same and have-seen same."
\v 8 Philip is-saying to{same}, "Lord, show to{us} the Father and it-is-satisfying to{us}."
\v 9 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "I-am-being alongside of{you} the-which-the-same time and you-have_not_known me, Philip[?] The having-seen emphatically-me has-seen the Father, and how[?] you are-saying, 'Show to{us} the Father'[?]
\v 10 You-are_not_believing that I in to{the Father} and the Father is-being in to{emphatically-me}[?] I am-speaking the say-effects/statements to{you}, which I-am_not_speaking from of{myself}; moreover, the Father, the remaining in to{emphatically-me}, same is-doing the works.
\v 11 Be-believing/entrusting to{me}, that I in to{the Father} and the Father in to{emphatically-me}; moreover, if not, be-believing/entrusting to{me} through the same works.
\v 12 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, the believing/entrusting into emphatically-me, the works which I am-doing, also-the-there will-do, and greater of{the-same} he-will-do, that I am-being-gone toward the Father,
\v 13 and which, what supposing you-may-give-cause/request in to{the name} of{me}, I-will-do the-same, in-which-place the Father may-be-esteem-ized/glorified in to{the son}.
\v 14 If-supposing what you-may-give-cause/request in to{the name} of{me}, I will-do.
\v 15 If-supposing you-may-be-loving me, keep the commands, the mine,
\v 16 and I will-ask the Father and he-will-give another call-aside/beside/near/advocate to{you}, in-which-place he-may-be-remaining alongside of{you} into the eon,
\v 17 the Spirit of{the truth}, which the world is_not_being-enabled to-take, that it-is_not_observing same, nor is-knowing same; moreover, you are-knowing same, that beside/near to{you} he-is-remaining and he-is-being in to{you}.
\v 18 I-will_not_let-off/away-from you bereft; I-am-being-come toward you
\v 19 still little, and the world is-observing me not still; moreover, you are-observing me, that I am-being-alive and you will-be-alive.
\v 20 In to{the-there, the day,} you will-know that I in to{the Father} of{me} and you in to{emphatically-me} and-I in to{you}.
\v 21 The having the commands of{me} and keeping same, the-there is-being the loving me. Moreover, the loving me will-be-loved under of{the Father} of{me}, and I will-love same and will-in-reveal-ize myself to{same}."
\v 22 Judas, not the Iscariot, is-saying to{same}, "Lord, and what[?] has-become, that to{us} you-are-being-about to-be-in-reveal-izing yourself, and emphatically-not to{the world}[?]"
\v 23 The Jesus responds and says to{same}, if-supposing anyone may-be-loving me, he-will-keep the word of{me}, and the Father of{me} will-love same, and we-will-be-come toward same, and we-will-make-such-as-to-be-made abode beside to{same}.
\v 24 The not loving me is_not_keeping the words of{me}, and the word which you-are-hearing is_not_being mine; contrariwise, of{the Father dispatch[ing]} me.
\v 25 I-have-spoken to{you} the-same, remaining beside to{you};
\v 26 moreover, the call-aside/beside/near/advocate, the Spirit, the Holy, which the Father will-dispatch in to{the name} of{me}, the-there will-teach you all[neuter], and will-remind-under you all[neuter] which I-say to{you}.
\v 27 Peace I-am-letting-off/away to{you}. I-am-giving to{you} peace, the mine, not according-as the world is-giving I am-giving to{you}. The heart of{you}: do_not_be-being-disturbed; nor, [the heart of{you}:] be-cower-ing.
\v 28 You-hear that I say to{you}, I-am-withdrawing and I-am-being-come toward you. If you-have-been-loving me, you-are-joyed, supposing that I-am-being-gone toward the Father, that the Father of{me} is-being greater-than of{me},
\v 29 and now I-have-said to{you} prior to-be-become, in-which-place, when-supposing it-may-be-become, you-may-believe.
\v 30 Not-still I-will-speak many [things] alongside of{you}, for the chief of{the world} is-being-come, and in to{emphatically-me} he-is_not_having, not-one/nothing.
\v 31 Contrariwise, in-which-place the world may-know that I-am-loving the Father, and according-as the Father commands to{me}, the-same-ly I-am-doing. Be-being-roused; we-may-be-leading from-here."
\c 15
\v 1 I am-being the vine, the genuine, and the Father of{me} is-being the land-worker.
\v 2 He-is-lifting same every break/lot-effect[i.e. resulting branch] in to{emphatically-me} not carrying fruit, and is-purifying/cleaning same every carrying the fruit, in-which-place it/he-may-be-carrying much-more fruit.
\v 3 Already you are-being purged/clean through the word which I-have-spoken to{you}.
\v 4 Remain in to{emphatically-me}, and-I in to{you}. According-as the break/lot-effect[i.e. resulting branch] is_not_being-enabled to-be-carrying fruit from of{sameself} if-supposing it-should_not_remain in to{the vine}, the-same-ly nor you, if-supposing you-should_not_remain in to{emphatically-me}.
\v 5 I am-being the vine, you the break/lot-effects[i.e. resulting branches]. The remaining in to{emphatically-me}, and-I in to{same}, the-same is-carrying much fruit, that separate of{emphatically-me} you-are_not_being-enabled to-be-making/doing, not-one/nothing.
\v 6 If-supposing any should_not_remain in to{emphatically-me}, it/he-is-cast outside as the break/lot-effect[i.e. resulting branch], and it/he-is-withered/dried, and they-are-gathering same and are-casting into fire, and it/he-is-being-ignited.
\v 7 If-supposing you-may-remain in to{emphatically-me} and the say-effects/statements of{me} may-remain in to{you}, what if-supposing you-may-be-will-ing, you-will-give-cause/request and it-will-be-become to{you}.
\v 8 In to{the-same} the Father of{me} is-esteem-ized/glorified, in-which-place you-may-be-carrying much fruit, and disciples to{emphatically-me} you-will-become.
\v 9 According-as the Father loves me also-I love you. Remain in to{the love, the mine}.
\v 10 If-supposing you-may-keep the commands of{me}, you-will-remain in to{the love} of{me} according-as I have-kept the commands of{the Father} of{me} and I-am-remaining in to{the love} of{same}.
\v 11 I-have-spoken the-same to{you} in-which-place the joy, the mine, may-remain in to{you} and the joy of{you} may-be-filled-full.
\v 12 The-same is-being the command, the mine, in-which-place you-may-be-loving one-another according-as I-love you.
\v 13 Not-one is-having greater love of{the-same} in-which-place someone may-place the life of{same} over/for-the-sake of{the friends} of{same}.
\v 14 You are-being friends of{me}, if-supposing you-may-be-doing as-much-as I am-commanding to{you}.
\v 15 Not-still I-am-saying you "slaves," that the slave has_not_beheld what the lord of{same} is-doing; moreover, I-have-said you "friends," that all which I-hear beside of{the Father} of{me} I-know-ize to{you}.
\v 16 You do_not_choose me; contrariwise, I choose you and place you, in-which-place you may-be-withdrawing and may-be-carrying fruit, and the fruit of{you} may-be-remaining, in-which-place which what supposing you-may-give-cause/request the Father in to{the name} of{me} he-may-give to{you}.
\v 17 I-am-commanding to{you} the-same in-which-place you-may-be-loving one-another.
\v 18 If the world is-hating you, you-are-knowing that it-has-hated emphatically-me first of{you}.
\v 19 If supposing you-have-been-being out of{the world}, the world has-been-being-fond-of the own/self; moreover, that out of{the world} you-are_not_being; contrariwise, I choose you out of{the world}. Through the-same the world is-hating you.
\v 20 Be-remembering of{the word which} I say to{you}, '[A] slave is_not_being greater-than of{the lord} of{same}.' If they-chase emphatically-me, also they-will-chase you; if they-keep the word of{me}, also they-will-keep the yours.
\v 21 Contrariwise, they-will-do the-same all to{you} through the name of{me}, that they-have_not_beheld the dispatch[ing] me.
\v 22 If I-do_not_come and speak to{same}, they-have_not_been-having sin; moreover, now they-are_not_having reveal-before-sis[i.e. pretext/pretense/excuse] about of{the sin} of{same}.
\v 23 The hating emphatically-me also is-hating the Father of{me}.
\v 24 If I-do_not_do the works in to{same}, which not-one other has-done, they-have_not_been-having sin; moreover, now also they-have-seen and have-hated also emphatically-me and the Father of{me}.
\v 25 Contrariwise, in-which-place the word, the having-been-written in to{the law} of{same} may-be-fulfilled, that they-hate me gratuitously.
\v 26 Moreover, when-supposing the call-aside/beside/near/advocate may-come, whom I will-dispatch to{you} beside of{the Father}, the Spirit of{the truth}, which beside of{the Father} is-being-gone-out, the-there will-witness about of{emphatically-me}.
\v 27 Moreover, also you are-witnessing that from of{origin} you-are-being alongside of{emphatically-me}."
\c 16
\v 1 "I-have-spoken the-same to{you} in-which-place you-may_not_be-scandalized.
\v 2 They-will-make off/away-from-gathering[translit. 'synagogue']-ible[adjective] you; contrariwise, [an] hour is-being-come in-which-place every, the kill[ing]-off/away you, may-esteem to-be-toward-carrying employ-ia to{the God},
\v 3 and they-will-do the-same, that they-do_not_know the Father nor emphatically-me.
\v 4 Contrariwise, I-have-spoken the-same to{you} in-which-place when-supposing the hour may-come you-may-be-remembering of{same} that I say to{you}; moreover, I-do_not_say the-same to{you} out of{origin}, that alongside of{you} I-have-been-being.
\v 5 Moreover, now I-am-withdrawing toward the dispatch[ing] me, and not-one out of{you} is-asking me, 'Where[?] you-are-withdrawing[?]'
\v 6 Contrariwise, that I-have-spoken the-same to{you} the grief has-filled-full the heart of{you}.
\v 7 Contrariwise, I am-saying the truth to{you}. It-is-carrying/bearing-together to{you} in-which-place I may-come-off/away, for if-supposing I-may_not_come-off/away, the call-aside/beside/near/advocate will_not_be-come toward you; moreover, if-supposing I-may-be-gone, I-will-dispatch same toward you,
\v 8 and, come[ing], the-there will-confute the world about of{sin} and about of{justice-ness} and about of{judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]};
\v 9 about of{sin}, on-one-hand, that they-are_not_believing/entrusting into emphatically-me;
\v 10 about of{justice-ness}, on-the-other-hand, that I-am-withdrawing toward the Father of{me} and not-still you-are-observing me;
\v 11 on-the-other-hand, about of{judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]}, that the chief of{the world, the-same,} has-been-judged.
\v 12 Still I-am-having many [things] to-be-saying to{you}; contrariwise, you-are_not_being-enabled to-be-bearing[weight] presently.
\v 13 Moreover, when-supposing the-there, the Spirit of{the truth}, may-come, he-will-lead-way you into every, the truth, for he-will_not_speak from of{sameself}; contrariwise, he-will-speak as-much-as supposing he-may-hear, and he-will-message-anew to{you} the being-come.
\v 14 The-there will-esteem-ize/glorify emphatically-me, that out of{the emphatically-me} he-will-take/get and will-message-anew to{you}.
\v 15 All as-much-as the Father is-having is-being mine. Through the-same I-say that out of{the emphatically-me} he-will-take/get and will-message-anew to{you}.
\v 16 Little and you-are_not_observing me, and again, little and you-will-see me, that I-am-withdrawing toward the Father."
\v 17 So, they-say, out of{the disciples} of{same} toward one-another, "What[?] is-being the-same, which he-is-saying to{us}, 'Little and you-are_not_observing me, and again, little and you-will-see me,' and, 'that I-am-withdrawing toward the Father.'[?]"
\v 18 So, they-have-been-saying, "What[?] is-being the-same, which he-is-saying, the 'little.' We-have_not_beheld what he-is-speaking."
\v 19 So, the Jesus knows that they-have-been-will-ing to-be-asking same, and says to{same}, "About of{the-same} you-are-seeking alongside of{one-another}, that I-say, 'Little and you-are_not_observing me, and again, little and you-will-see me.'
\v 20 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that you will-weep and will-lament; moreover, the world will-be-joyed; moreover, you will-be-grieved; contrariwise, the grief of{you} will-become into joy.
\v 21 The woman, when-supposing she-may-be-offspring-ing, is-having grief, that the hour of{same} comes; moreover, when-supposing she-may-beget the childling, not-still she-is-remembering of{the pressure/constriction/oppression} through the joy that [a] man is-begotten into the world.
\v 22 So, and you, on-one-hand now are-having grief; on-the-other-hand, again I-will-see you and the heart of{you} will-be-joyed, and not-one is-lifting from of{you} the joy of{you},
\v 23 and in to{the-there, the day,} you-will_not_ask emphatically-me, not-one. Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that as-much-as supposing you-may-give-cause/request the Father in to{the name} of{me} he-will-give to{you}.
\v 24 Until presently you-do_not_give-cause/request, not-one/nothing, in to{the name} of{me}. Be-giving-cause/requesting, and you-will-take/get, in-which-place the joy of{you} may-be-being having-been-fulfilled.
\v 25 I-have-spoken to{you} the-same in to{proverbs}. [An] hour is-being-come when not-still in to{proverbs} I-will-speak to{you}; contrariwise, I-will-message-anew to{you} to{all-say-ia} about of{the Father}.
\v 26 In to{the-there, the day,} you-will-give-cause/request in to{the name} of{me} and I-am_not_saying to{you} that I will-ask the Father about of{you},
\v 27 for same, the Father, is-being-fond-of you, that you have-been-fond-of emphatically-me and have-believed that I come-out beside of{the God}.
\v 28 I-come-out beside of{the Father} and I-have-come into the world. Again I-am-letting-off/away-from the world and am-being-gone toward the Father."
\v 29 The disciples of{same} are-saying to{same}, "Behold, now you-are-speaking to{all-say-ia} and are-saying not-one proverb.
\v 30 Now we-have-beheld that you-have-beheld all and are_not_having need in-which-place anyone may-be-asking you. In to{the-same[neuter]} we-are-believing that from of{God} you-come-out."
\v 31 The Jesus responds to{same}, "Presently you-are-believing.
\v 32 Behold, [an] hour is-being-come and now has-come in-which-place you-may-be-scattered, each into the own/selves and may-let-off/away emphatically-me alone, and I-am_not_being alone, that the Father is-being alongside of{emphatically-me}.
\v 33 I-have-spoken the-same to{you} in-which-place you-may-be-having peace in to{emphatically-me}. You-are-having pressure/constriction/oppression in to{the world}; contrariwise, be-having-courage; I have-conquered the world."
\c 17
\v 1 The Jesus speaks the-same, and he-lifts-upon the eyes of{same} into the heaven and says, "Father, the hour has-come. Esteem-ize/glorify the Son of{you} in-which-place also the Son of{you} may-esteem-ize/glorify you,

\v 3 Moreover, same is-being the eternal being-alive[noun] in-which-place they-may-be-knowing you, the only genuine God, and whom you-send-off/away, Jesus Anointed.
\v 4 I esteem-ize/glorify you upon of{the earth}. I-accomplish the work which you-have-given to{me} in-which-place I-may-do,

\v 12 When I-have-been-being alongside of{same} in to{the world}, I have-been-keeping same in to{the name} of{you}, whom you-have-given to{me}, I-guard, and not-one out of{same} perishes-off/away, if not the son of{the destruction/loss/perishment-off/away-ia}, in-which-place the scripture may-be-fulfilled.
\v 13 Moreover, now toward you I-am-being-come, and I-am-speaking the-same in to{the world}, in-which-place they-may-be-having the joy, the mine, having-been-filled-full in to{same}.
\v 14 I have-given to{same} the word of{you}, and the world hates same, that they-are_not_being out of{the world}, according-as I am_not_being out of{the world}.
\v 15 I-am_not_asking in-which-place you-may-lift same out of{the world}; contrariwise, in-which-place you-may-keep same out of{the evil}.
\v 16 They-are_not_being out of{the world}, according-as I am_not_being out of{the world}.
\v 17 Holy-ize same in to{the truth} of{you}; the word, the yours, is-being truth.
\v 18 According-as you-send-off/away emphatically-me into the world, also-I send-off/away same[plural] into the world,
\v 19 and over of{same[plural]} I am-holy-izing myself, in-which-place also same[plural] may-be-being having-been-holy-ized in to{truth}.
\v 20 Moreover, I-am-asking not about of{the-same[plural]} only; contrariwise also about of{the believing} through of{the word} of{same[plural]} into emphatically-me,
\v 21 in-which-place all may-be-being one according-as you, Father, in to{emphatically-me} and-I in to{you}, in-which-place also same[plural] may-be-being one in to{us}, in-which-place the world may-believe that you send-off/away me,
\v 22 and I have-given to{same[plural]} the esteem/glory which you-have-given to{me}, in-which-place they-may-be-being one according-as we are-being one,
\v 23 I in to{same[plural]} and you in to{emphatically-me}, in-which-place they-may-be-being having-been-accomplished into one, and in-which-place the world may-be-knowing that you send-off/away me and love same[plural] according-as you-love emphatically-me.
\v 24 Father, whom[plural] you-have-given to{me}, I-am-will-ing in-which-place which-where I am-being, also-the-there-s may-be-being alongside of{emphatically-me}, in-which-place they-may-be-observing the esteem/glory, the mine, which you-give to{me}, that you-love me before of{[the] cast-down} of{[the] world}.
\v 25 Just Father, also the world does_not_know you; moreover, I know you, and the-same[plural] know that you send-off/away me,
\v 26 and I-know-ize to{same[plural]} the name of{you}, and will-know-ize, in-which-place the love which you-love me may-be-being in to{same[plural]} and-I in to{same[plural]}."
\c 18
\v 1 Say[ing] the-same, the Jesus comes-out together-with to{the disciples} of{same}, other-side of{the bad-weather/storm-flow[i.e. some consequential valley/ravine]} of{the} Kidron, which-where has-been-being [a] plantation into which same comes-into, and the disciples of{same}.
\v 2 Moreover, also Judas, the giving-aside/delivering same, had-beheld the place, that often the Jesus is-gathered there alongside of{the disciples} of{same}.
\v 3 So, the Judas, take[ing] the [military]cohort and subordinates out of{the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests]} and of{Pharisees}, is-being-come there alongside of{revealings[noun]/illuminations} and of{torches} and of{implements/arms/weapons}.
\v 4 So, Jesus, having-beheld all the being-come upon same, come[ing]-out, says to{same}, "Whom[?] you-are-seeking[?]"
\v 5 They-respond to{same}, "Jesus, the Nazarene." The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "I am-being." Moreover, also Judas, the giving-aside/delivering same, had-stood alongside of{same}.
\v 6 So, as he-says to{same}, "I am-being," they-come-off/away into the behind and fall on-the-ground[adverb].
\v 7 So, again he-asks-upon same, "Whom[?] you-are-seeking[?]" Moreover, the say, "Jesus the Nazarene."
\v 8 Jesus responds, "I-say to{you} that I am-being. So, if you-are-seeking emphatically-me, let-off/away the-same[plural] to-be-withdrawing,
\v 9 in-which-place the word may-be-fulfilled which says that 'whom you-have-given to{me} I-do_not_lose-off/away out of{same}, not-one.'"
\v 10 So, Simon Peter, having [a] knife, pulls same and strikes the slave of{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}, and cuts-off/away the earlet of{same}, the right; moreover [the] name to{the slave} has-been-being "Malchus."
\v 11 So, the Jesus says to{the Peter}, "Cast the knife of{you} into the sheath/place. The Father has-given to{me} the cup which, no, I-should_not_drink same[?]"
\v 12 So, the [military]cohort and the thousand-chief/chiliarch and the subordinates of{the Judeans} together-take the Jesus, and bind same,
\v 13 and lead-off/away same toward Annas first, for he-has-been-being father-in-law of{the Caiaphas}, who has-been-being chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] of{the same-year, the-there}.
\v 14 Moreover, Caiaphas has-been-being the together-intention[ing] to{the Judeans}, that "it-is-carrying/bearing-together one man to-die-off/away over/for-the-sake of{the people}."
\v 15 Moreover, Simon Peter has-been-accompanying to{the Jesus}, and the another disciple; moreover, the disciple, the-there has-been-being known[adjective] to{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]} and comes-into-together to{the Jesus} into the courtyard of{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}.
\v 16 Moreover, the Peter had-stood toward to{the entrance/door} outside, so the disciple, the other, who has-been-being known[adjective] to{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}, comes-out and says to{the doorkeeper} and into-leads the Peter.
\v 17 So, the girlie, the doorkeeper, is-saying to{the Peter}, "Not also you are-being out of{the disciples} of{the man, the-same}[?]" The-there is-saying, "I-am_not_being."
\v 18 Moreover, the slaves and the subordinates had-stood, having-made [a] charcoal/coal-ia[fire], that it-has-been-being cold and they-have-been-being-warmed. Moreover, the Peter has-been-being alongside of{same}, having-stood and being-warmed.
\v 19 So, the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] asks the Jesus about of{the disciples} of{same} and about of{the teaching} of{same}.
\v 20 The Jesus responds to{same}, "I speak to{all-say-ia} to{the world}. I always teach in to{the gathering[translit. 'synagogue']} and in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, which-where the Judeans always are-being-come-together, and in to{hidden[adjective]} I-speak not-one/nothing.
\v 21 What[?] you-are-asking-upon me[?] Ask-upon the having-heard what I-speak to{same}. Behold, the-same have-beheld what I say."
\v 22 Moreover, of{same say[ing]} the-same, one of{the subordinates} having-stood-aside/beside/near gives slap-ize-effect to{the Jesus}, say[ing], "The-same-ly you-are-responding to{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}."
\v 23 The Jesus responds to{same}, "If badly I-speak, witness about of{the bad}; moreover, if well, what[?] you-are-flaying me[?]"
\v 24 So, the Annas sends-off/away same, having-been-bound, toward Caiaphas, the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest].
\v 25 Moreover, Simon Peter has-been-being having-stood and being-warmed. So, they-say to{same}, "Not also you are-being out of{the disciples} of{same}[?]" The-there denies and says, "I-am_not_being."
\v 26 One out of{the slaves} of{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]} being together-begotten[i.e. related] of{whom} Peter cuts-off/away the earlet is-saying, "Not I behold you in to{the plantation} alongside of{same}[?]"
\v 27 So, again the Peter denies, and straightaway [a] rooster sounds.
\v 28 So, they-are-leading the Jesus from of{the Caiaphas} into the praetorium[Latin]; moreover, it-has-been-being early/morning and same do_not_come-into into the praetorium[Latin] in-which-place they-would_not_be-tainted/contaminated; contrariwise, in-which-place they-may-eat the passover.
\v 29 So, the Pilate comes-out outside toward same[plural] and says, "What[?] accusation you-are-carrying against of{the man, the-same}[?]"
\v 30 They-respond and say to{same}, "If supposing the-same has_not_been-being bad-doing-ful, we-do_not_give-aside/deliver same to{you}."
\v 31 So, the Pilate says to{same}, "You, take same and judge same according-to the law of{you}." So, the Judeans say to{same}, "To{us} is_not_being-permitted to-kill-off/away, not-one,"
\v 32 in-which-place the word of{the Jesus} may-be-fulfilled, which he-says signifying to{about-what-such death} he-has-been-being-about to-be-dying-off/away.
\v 33 So, the Pilate comes-into into the praetorium[Latin] again, and sounds the Jesus, and says to{same}, "You are-being the king of{the Judeans}[?]"
\v 34 The Jesus responds, "From of{sameself} you are-saying the-same, or others say to{you} about of{emphatically-me}[?]"
\v 35 The Pilate responds, "Not-what[?] I am-being Judean[?] The nation, the yours, and the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] give-aside/deliver you to{emphatically-me}. What[?] you-do[?]"
\v 36 Jesus responds, "The kingdom, the mine, is_not_being out of{the world, the-same}. If supposing out of{the world, the-same} has-been-being the kingdom, the mine, the subordinates, the to{emphatically-me}, have-been-competing/contending, in-which-place I-would_not_be-given-aside/delivered to{the Judeans}; moreover, now the kingdom, the mine, is_not_being from-here."
\v 37 So, the Pilate says to{same}, "So-not[?], you are-being [a] king[?]" Jesus responds, "You are-saying that I am-being [a] king. Into the-same I have-been-begotten, and into the-same I-have-come into the world, in-which-place I-may-witness to{the truth}. Every, the being out of{the truth}, is-hearing of{me, the sound}."
\v 38 The Pilate is-saying to{same}, "What[?] is-being truth[?]," and, say[ing] the-same, again he-comes-out toward the Judeans and is-saying to{same}, "I am-discovering not-one cause in to{same}.
\v 39 Moreover, it-is-being together-habituation to{you} in-which-place I-may-loose-off/away one to{you} in to{the passover}. So, you-are-intending I-may-loose-off/away to{you} the king of{the Judeans}[?]"
\v 40 So, all cry-out-ize, saying, "Not the-same; contrariwise, the bar-Abbas." Moreover, the bar-Abbas has-been-being [a] robber.
\c 19
\v 1 So, then, the Pilate takes the Jesus and scourges,
\v 2 and the soldiers, weave[ing] [a] garland/crown out of{thorn-bushes}, place-upon to{the head} of{same}, and drape-around purple outer-garment same,
\v 3 and they-have-been-saying, "Be-joying, the king of{the Judeans}," and they-have-been-giving slap-ize-effects to{same}.
\v 4 So, again the Pilate comes-out outside and is-saying to{same[plural]}, "Behold, I-am-leading same outside to{you}, in-which-place you-may-know that in to{same} I-am-discovering not-one cause."
\v 5 So, the Jesus comes-out outside, carrying/bearing the thorny garland/crown and the purple outer-garment, and he-is-saying to{same[plural]}, "Behold the man."
\v 6 So, when the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the subordinates behold same, they-cry-out-ize, saying, "Crucify, crucify same." The Pilate is-saying to{same}, "You, take same and crucify, for I am_not_discovering cause in to{same}."
\v 7 The Judeans respond to{same}, "We are-having [a] law, and according-to the law of{us} it-is-owing to-die-off/away, that he-makes sameself Son of{God}."
\v 8 So, when the Pilate hears the-same, the word, he-fears more,
\v 9 and he-comes-into into the praetorium[Latin] again and is-saying to{the Jesus}, "Whence you are-being[?]"; moreover, the Jesus does_not_give response to{same}.
\v 10 So, the Pilate is-saying to{same}, "To{emphatically-me} you-are_not_speaking[?] You-have_not_beheld that I-am-having authority to-crucify you and I-am-having authority to-loose-off/away you[?]"
\v 11 The Jesus responds, "You-have_not_been-having authority, not-one, against/according-to of{emphatically-me} if not it-has-been-being having-been-given to{you} up-place-ly. Through the-same, the giving-aside/delivering me to{you} is-having greater sin."
\v 12 Out of{the-same} the Pilate has-been-seeking to-loose-off/away same; moreover, the Judeans have-been-cry-out-izing, saying, "If-supposing you-may-loose-off/away the-same, you-are_not_being friend of{the Caesar}. Every, the making sameself king, is-saying-in-place-of/in-opposition-to/contradicting/rebutting to{the Caesar}."
\v 13 So, the Pilate, hear[ing] of{the words, the-same}, leads the Jesus outside and sits-down upon of{the step-effect} into [the] place being-said, "stone-paved/spread;" moreover, Hebrew-ly "gabbatha."
\v 14 Moreover, preparation has-been-being of{the} passover; [the] hour has-been-being as-if sixth, and he-is-saying to{the Judeans}, "Behold, the king of{you}."
\v 15 Moreover, the[plural] cry-out-ize, "Lift, lift, crucify same." The Pilate is-saying to{same}, "I-will-crucify the king of{you}." The chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] respond, "We-are_not_having [a] king if not Caesar."
\v 16 So, then he-gives-aside/delivers same to{same[plural]} in-which-place he-may-be-crucified. Moreover they-take-aside the Jesus and lead-off/away,
\v 17 and, bearing[weight] the cross of{sameself}, he-comes-out into the being-said, "place of{skull}," which Hebrew-ly is-being-said, "Golgotha,"
\v 18 which-where they-crucify same, and alongside of{same} two others, from-here and from-here; moreover, the Jesus midst.
\v 19 Moreover, also the Pilate writes [a] title, and places upon of{the cross}; moreover, it-has-been-being having-been-written, "Jesus the Nazarene, the king of{the Judeans}."
\v 20 So, many know-anew the-same, the title, of{the Judeans}, that the place has-been-being near of{the city}, which-where the Jesus is-crucified, and it-has-been-being having-been-written Hebrew-ly, Greek-ly, Latin-ly.
\v 21 So, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] of{the Judeans} have-been-saying to{the Pilate}, "Do_not_be-writing, 'The king of{the Judeans};' contrariwise, that the-there says, 'I-am-being king of{the Judeans}.'"
\v 22 The Pilate responds, "What I-have-written I-have-written."
\v 23 So, when the soldiers crucify the Jesus, they-take the outer-garments of{same} and make four parts, [a] part to{each soldier}, and the inner-garment; moreover, the inner-garment has-been-being seamless out of{the} up-place-ly interwoven[adjective] through of{whole}.
\v 24 So, they-say toward one-another, "We-should_not_split same; contrariwise, we-should-obtain[i.e. cast lot] about of{same}, of{whom} it-will-be," in-which-place the scripture may-be-fulfilled, the saying, "They-part/divide-through-selves the outer-garments of{me} to{sameselves} and upon the outer-garment-set of{me} they-cast lot." So, on-one-hand, the soldiers do the-same;
\v 25 on-the-other-hand the mother of{same}, and the sister of{the mother} of{same}, Mary, the of{the Clopas}, and Mary, the Magdalene, had-stood beside to{the cross} of{the Jesus}.
\v 26 So, Jesus, behold[ing] the mother and the disciple having-stood-beside, whom he-has-been-loving, is-saying to{the mother} of{same}, "Woman, behold, the son of{you}."
\v 27 Thereafter/accordingly, he-is-saying to{the disciple}, "Behold, the mother of{you}," and from of{the-there, the hour} the disciple takes same[feminine] into the own.
\v 28 Alongside the-same, the Jesus, having-beheld that all already has-been-completed, in-which-place the scripture may-be-accomplished, is-saying, "I-am-thirsting."
\v 29 So, [a] vessel has-been-being-lain, replete of{vinegar}; moreover, the[masculine plural], fill[ing] [a] sponge of{vinegar} and place[ing]-around to{hyssop}, carry-toward to{the mouth} of{same}.
\v 30 So, when the Jesus takes the vinegar, he-says, "It-has-been-completed," and, lean[ing] the head, he-gives-aside/delivers the spirit/breath.
\v 31 So, the Judeans, since it-has-been-being preparation, in-which-place the bodies should_not_remain upon of{the cross} in to{the sabbath}, for great has-been-being the day of{the-there, the sabbath}, ask the Pilate in-which-place the legs of{same} may-be-broken-down and they-may-be-lifted.
\v 32 So, the soldiers come and, on-one-hand, break-down the legs of{the first} and of{the other} of{the crucified-together} to{same}.
\v 33 On-the-other-hand, come[ing] upon the Jesus, as they-behold same already having-died, they-do_not_break-down the legs of{same}.
\v 34 Contrariwise, one of{the soldiers} pierces the side to{spear-head/lance} of{same}, and straightaway blood and water comes-out,
\v 35 and the having-seen has-witnessed and the witness-ia of{same} is-being genuine, and-the-there has-beheld that he-is-saying true, in-which-place also you may-believe,
\v 36 for the-same is-become in-which-place the scripture may-be-fulfilled, "[A] bone will_not_be-worn-down-together/broken/crushed of{same},"
\v 37 and again [a] different-other scripture is-saying, "They-will-see into whom they-goad/prick/sting/stab-out."
\v 38 Moreover, alongside the-same, Joseph, the from of{Arimathea}, being [a] disciple of{the Jesus}, moreover having-been-hidden through the fear of{the Judeans}, asks the Pilate in-which-place he-may-lift the body of{the Jesus}, and the Pilate upon-turns, so he-comes and lifts the body of{the Jesus}.
\v 39 Moreover, also Nicodemus comes, the come[ing] toward the Jesus of{night}, the first, carrying [a] mix-effect of{myrrh} and of{aloe} as-if [a] hundred litras[Latin "libra"].
\v 40 So, they-take the body of{the Jesus} and bind same to{linen-cloths} alongside of{the aromatics} according-as is-being [the] custom to{the Judeans} to-be-en-burial-izing.
\v 41 Moreover, [a] plantation has-been-being in to{the place} which-where he-is-crucified, and in to{the plantation} [a] new memorial in to{which} not-moreover-yet-ly not-one is-placed.
\v 42 So, there, through the preparation of{the Judeans}, that the memorial has-been-being near, they-place the Jesus.
\c 20
\v 1 Moreover, to{the one} of{the sabbaths}, Mary, the Magdalene, is-being-come early/morning still of{being darkness-ia} into the memorial and is-viewing the stone, having-been-lifted out of{the memorial}.
\v 2 So, she-is-hurrying and is-being-come toward Simon Peter and toward the other disciple whom the Jesus has-been-being-fond-of, and she-is-saying to{same}, "They-lift the Lord out of{the memorial} and we-have_not_beheld where[?] they-place same."
\v 3 So, the Peter comes-out, and the other disciple, and they-have-been-being-come into the memorial.
\v 4 Moreover, the two of{like} have-been-hurrying and the other disciple hurries-before more-speedily of{the Peter} and comes first into the memorial,
\v 5 and, stoop[ing]-beside, he-is-viewing the linen-cloths being-lain. Nevertheless, he-does_not_come-into.
\v 6 So, Simon Peter, accompanying to{same}, is-being-come, and comes-into into the memorial, and is-observing the linen-cloths being-lain
\v 7 and the sudarium[Latin]/towel/napkin/cloth which has-been-being upon of{the head} of{same}, not alongside of{the linen-cloths}, being-lain; contrariwise, separate, having-been-enveloped into one place.
\v 8 So, then also the other disciple, the come[ing] first, comes-into into the memorial and beholds and believes,
\v 9 for not-moreover-yet-ly they-had-beheld the scripture, that it-is-necessitating same to-stand-up/anew out of{dead}.
\v 10 So, again the disciples come-off/away toward sameselves.
\v 11 Moreover, Mary had-stood toward the memorial outside, weeping. So, as she-has-been-weeping, she-stoops-beside into the memorial
\v 12 and is-observing two messengers in to{white/bright} being-seat-ized, one toward to{the head} and one toward to{the feet}, which-where the body of{the Jesus} has-been-being-lain,
\v 13 and the-there-s are-saying to{same}, "Woman, what[?] you-are-weeping[?]" She-is-saying to{same} that "they-lift the Lord of{me} and I-have_not_beheld where[?] they-place same,"
\v 14 and, say[ing] the-same, she-is-turned into the behind and is-observing the Jesus having-stood, and she-had_not_beheld that he-is-being the Jesus.
\v 15 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Woman, what[?] you-are-weeping; who[?] you-are-seeking[?]" The-there[feminine], esteeming that he-is-being the plantation-keeper, is-saying to{same}, "lord, if you bear[weight] same, say to{me} where[?] you-place same and-I will-lift same."
\v 16 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Mary." Turned, the-there is-saying to{same} Hebrew-ly, "Rabboni," which is-being-said, "Teacher."
\v 17 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Do_not_be-taking-hold of{me}, for I-have_not-yet_ascended toward the Father of{me}; moreover, be-being-gone toward the brothers of{me} and say to{same}, "I-am-ascending toward the Father of{me} and Father of{you}, and God of{me} and God of{you}."
\v 18 Mary, the Magdalene, is-being-come, messaging-off/away to{the disciples} that she-has-seen the Lord, and/also the-same [things] he-says to{same[feminine]}.
\v 19 So, of{being late/evening} to{the day, the-there, the one} of{the sabbaths} and of{the doors having-been-closed}, which-where the disciples have-been-being having-been-gathered through the fear of{the Judeans}, the Jesus comes and stands into the midst, and is-saying to{same}, "Peace to{you},"
\v 20 and, say[ing] the-same, he-shows to{same} the hands and the side of{same}. So, the disciples are-joyed, behold[ing] the Lord.
\v 21 So, the Jesus says to{same} again, "Peace to{you}. According-as the Father has-sent-off/away me, also-I am-dispatching you,"
\v 22 and, say[ing] the-same, he-breathes/blows-in and is-saying to{same}, "Take Holy Spirit.
\v 23 Supposing of{any[plural]} you-may-let-off/away the sins, they-are-being-let-off/away to{same}; supposing of{any[plural]} you-may-be-holding, they-have-been-held."
\v 24 Moreover, Thomas, one out of{the} twelve, the being-said "Didymus," has_not_been-being alongside of{same[plural]} when the Jesus comes.
\v 25 So, the other disciples have-been-saying to{same}, "We-have-seen the Lord." Moreover, the says to{same}, if-supposing I-would_not_behold in to{the hands} of{same} the imprint of{the nails} and may-cast the finger of{me} into the imprint of{the nails} and may-cast the hand of{me} into the side of{same}, no, I-will_not_believe,"
\v 26 and alongside eight days again the disciples of{same} have-been-being within and Thomas alongside of{same}. The Jesus is-being-come of{the doors having-been-closed} and stands into the midst and says, "Peace to{you}."
\v 27 Thereafter, he-is-saying to{the Thomas}, "Be-carrying the finger of{you} here and behold the hands of{me}, and be-carrying the hand of{you} and cast into the side of{me}, and do_not_be-becoming unbelieving[adjective]; contrariwise, believing[adjective],"
\v 28 and Thomas responds and says to{same}, "The Lord of{me} and the God of{me}."
\v 29 The Jesus is-saying to{same} that "you-have-seen me; you-have-believed. Blessed, the not behold[ing] and believe[ing]."
\v 30 So, on-one-hand, the Jesus also does many other signs in-sight of{the disciples} of{same}, which is_not_being having-been-written in to{the scrollet, the-same};
\v 31 on-the-other-hand, the-same has-been-written in-which-place you-may-believe that the Jesus is-being the Anointed, the Son of{the God}, and in-which-place, believing, you-may-be-having being-alive[noun] in to{the name} of{same}.
\c 21
\v 1 Alongside the-same, the Jesus reveals sameself again to{the disciples} upon of{the seawater, the Tiberias}. Moreover, he-reveals the-same-ly.
\v 2 They-have-been-being of{like}, Simon Peter, and Thomas, the being-said "Didymus," and Nathanael, the from Cana of{the Galilee}, and the[plural] of{the Zebedee}, and two others out of{the disciples} of{same}.
\v 3 Simon Peter is-saying to{same}, "I-am-withdrawing to-be-fishing." They-are-saying to{same}, "We-are-being-come, and we together-with to{you}." They-come-out and step-in into the boat and in to{the-there, the night} grab-hold-of not-one/nothing.
\v 4 Moreover, already of{early/morning become[ing]}, the Jesus stands into the shore. Nevertheless, the disciples had_not_beheld that it-is-being Jesus.
\v 5 So, the Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Childlings, no what[?] you-are-having toward-eat[noun][?]" They-respond to{same}, "Not."
\v 6 Moreover, the says to{same}, "Cast the net into the right parts/portions of{the boat} and you-will-discover." So, they-cast and not-still they-have-strength to-pull same, from of{the multitude} of{the fishes}.
\v 7 So, the disciple, the-there, whom the Jesus has-been-loving, is-saying to{the Peter}, "It-is-being the Lord." So, Simon Peter, hear[ing] that it-is-being the Lord, through-girds the upon-clothing, for he-has-been-being naked, and casts sameself into the seawater.
\v 8 Moreover, the other disciples come to{the small-boat}, for they-have_not_been-being far from of{the land}; contrariwise, as from of{two-hundred cubits}, dragging the net of{the fishes}.
\v 9 So, as they-step-off into the land, they-are-viewing [a] charcoal/coal-ia[fire] being-lain, and side-portion-ie being-lain-upon, and bread.
\v 10 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Carry from of{the side-portion-ies which} you-grab-hold-of now."
\v 11 So, Simon Peter ascends and pulls the net into the land replete of{[a] hundred fifty three large fishes}, and of{the-which-the-same being}, the net is_not_split.
\v 12 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Come! Have-breakfast/lunch." Moreover, not-one has-been-daring of{the disciples} to-examine-out same, "You who[?] are-being," having-beheld that it-is-being the Lord.
\v 13 So, the Jesus is-being-come and is-taking the bread and is-giving to{same}, and the side-portion-ie similarly.
\v 14 Already the Jesus is-revealed to{the disciples} of{same} [the] third, the-same, roused out of{dead}.
\v 15 So, when they-have-breakfast/lunch, the Jesus is-saying to{the Simon Peter}, "Simon of{Jonah}, you-are-loving me much-more of{the-same[masculine plural]}[?]" He-is-saying to{same}, "Yes, Lord, you have-beheld that I-am-being-fond-of you." He-is-saying to{same}, "Be-grazing the lambkins of{me}."
\v 16 He-is-saying to{same} again second[ly], "Simon of{Jonah}, you-are-loving me[?]" He-is-saying to{same}, "Yes, Lord, you have-beheld that I-am-being-fond-of you. He-is-saying to{same}, "Be-shepherding the sheep of{me}."
\v 17 He-is-saying to{same}, the third, "Simon of{Jonah}, you-are-being-fond-of me[?]" The Peter is-grieved that he-says to{same}, the third, "You-are-being-fond-of me," and he-says to{same}, "Lord, you have-beheld all. You are-knowing that I-am-being-fond-of you." The Jesus is-saying to{same}, "Be-grazing the sheep of{me}.
\v 18 Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, when you-have-been-being younger, you-have-been-girding yourself and have-been-walking-around which-where you-have-been-will-ing; moreover, when-supposing you-may-age, you-will-stretch-out the hands of{you} and another will-gird you, and will-carry which-where you-are_not_will-ing."
\v 19 Moreover, he-says the-same signifying to{about-what-such death} he-will-esteem-ize/glorify the God and, say[ing] the-same, he-is-saying to{same}, "Be-accompanying to{me}."
\v 20 Moreover, upon-turned, the Peter is-viewing the disciple whom the Jesus has-been-loving, accompanying, who also falls-up/anew in to{the dinner/supper} upon the chest/sternum of{same} and says, "Lord, who[?] is-being the giving-aside/delivering you[?]"
\v 21 Behold[ing] the-same, the Peter is-saying to{the Jesus}, "Lord, moreover, the-same[masculine], what[?]"
\v 22 The Jesus is-saying to{same}, if-supposing I-may-be-will-ing same to-be-staying until I-am-being-come, what[?] toward you[?] You, be-accompanying to{me}."
\v 23 So, the-same, the word, comes-out into the brothers that the disciple, the-there, is_not_dying-off/away, and the Jesus does_not_say to{same} that he-is_not_dying-off/away; contrariwise, "If-supposing I-may-be-will-ing same to-be-staying until I-am-being-come, what[?] toward you[?]"
\v 24 The-same is-being the disciple, the witnessing about of{the-same} and write[ing] the-same, and we-have-beheld that the witness-ia of{same} is-being true.
\v 25 Moreover, it-is-being also many other as-many-as the Jesus does, the-which if-supposing it-may-be-being-written according-to one, not-moreover I-am-presuming-self same, the world, to-make-space, the being-written scrollets. Amen.
