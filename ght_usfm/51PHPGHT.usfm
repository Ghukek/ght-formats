\v 21 and you, at-what-time being having-belonged-to-others-off/away-from and hostile to{the through-mind/thinking} in to{the works, the evil}, moreover emphatically-now alters-according-to-off/away/reconciles-off/away
\v 22 in to{the body} of{the flesh} of{same} through of{the death} to-stand-aside you holy and unblemished and without-call-in/charge/indictment down-in-sight of{same},
\v 23 if indeed you-are-remaining-upon to{the faith} having-been-foundation-ed and situated, and not being-change-moved from of{the expectation} of{the good-message which} you-hear, of{the be[ing]-proclaimed} in to{every, the creation, the} under the heaven of{which} I, Paul, become servant.
\v 24 Now I-am-joying in to{the suffer-effects} over/for-the-sake of{you} and I-am-filling-full-anew-in-place-of the deficient/lack-effects of{the pressures/constrictions/oppressions} of{the Anointed} in to{the flesh} of{me} over/for-the-sake of{the body} of{same}, which is-being the out-calling,
\v 25 of{which} I become [a] servant according-to the house-legislation of{the God}, the given to{me} into you to-fulfill the word of{the God},
\v 26 the mystery, the having-been-concealed-off/away from of{the eons} and from of{the generations}. Moreover, emphatically-now it-is-revealed to{the[plural] holy} of{same},
\v 27 to{whom} the God wills to-know-ize what [is] the riches of{the esteem/glory} of{the mystery, the-same} in to{the nations}, who is-being Anointed in to{you}, the expectation of{the esteem/glory},
\v 28 whom we are-messaging-according-to, placing-in-mind/exhorting every man and teaching every man in to{every wisdom} in-which-place we-may-stand-aside every man accomplished in to{Anointed Jesus},
\v 29 into which also I-am-toiling, competing/contending according-to the work-in-ia of{same}, the being-worked-in in to{emphatically-me} in to{enablement/empowerment},
\c 2
\v 1 for I-am-will-ing you to-have-beheld [the] such contention/struggle/agony I-am-having over/for-the-sake of{you} and of{the} in to{Laodicea} and as-many-as have_not_seen have_not_seen the face of{me} in to{flesh},
\v 2 in-which-place the hearts of{same, step-ized-together} in to{love}, may-be-called-aside also into all riches of{the full-carry-ia} of{the put-together-sis[i.e. state of comprehension/intellegence]} into knowledge-upon of{the mystery} of{the God and Father} and of{the Anointed},
\v 3 in to{whom[singular]} all the wealths of{the wisdom} and of{the knowledge} are-being hidden-off/away[adjective].
\v 4 Moreover, I-am-saying the-same in-which-place no-one would-be-word-izing/reckoning/accounting-aside[translit. paralogism]/deluding you in to{persuasive-word-ia},
\v 5 for if also I-am-being-off/away to{the flesh}; contrariwise, to{the Spirit} I-am-being together-with to{you}, joying and viewing the set-sis[i.e. set state]/order/arrangement of{you} and the firm/solid-effect/solidification/stability of{the faith} of{you} into Anointed.
\v 6 So, as you-take-aside the Anointed Jesus, the Lord, be-walking-around in to{same},
\v 7 having-been-rooted and being-house-built-upon in to{same} and being-confirmed in to{the faith} according-as you-are-taught, exceeding in to{same} in to{well-favor-ia/thanksgiving}.
\v 8 Be-viewing not anyone will-be the plunder-leading[captive] you through of{the fond-wisdom/philosophy} and of{empty deceit} according-to the give-aside/delivery of{the men} according-to the in-line-withs of{the world} and not according-to Anointed,
\v 9 that in to{same} is-housing-down the every full-effect of{the God-ness} bodily,
\v 10 and you-are-being having-been-filled-full in to{same}, who is-being the head of{every origin/original/chief and authority},
\v 11 in to{whom} also you-are-circumcised to{un-hand-made circumcision} in to{the out-clothe/disrobe-off/away} of{the body} of{the flesh} in to{the circumcision} of{the Anointed},
\v 12 buried-together to{same} in to{the immersion-effect} in to{whom} also you-are-roused-together through of{the faith} of{the work-in-ia} of{the God, the rouse[ing]} same out of{dead},
\v 13 and you, being dead in to{the fall-aside-effects} and to{the foreskin-ia} of{the flesh} of{you}, he-makes-alive-together together-with to{same}, favor-ize[ing] to{us} all the fall-aside-effects,
\v 14 oil[ing]-out the according-to of{us} handwriting to{the esteem-effects/decrees}, which has-been-being under-in-in-place-of[/opposite-beneath/facing-beneath]/subcontrary/contradictory/incongruous to{us}, and he-has-lifted same out of{the midst}, nail[ing]_same_toward nail[ing]_same_toward to{the cross}.
\v 15 Out-clothe[ing]/disrobe[ing]-off/away the origins/originals/chiefs and the authorities, he-show-effect-izes in to{all-say-ia}, triumph[ing][after victory] same[plural] in to{same[singular]}.
\v 16 So, not anyone: be-judging you in to{eat-up-sis[i.e. state of consuming]} or in to{drink-sis[i.e. state of drinking]} or in to{part/portion/share} of{festival} or of{fresh-month/moon} or of{sabbaths},
\v 17 which[plural] it-is-being [a] shadow of{the about-to-be-being}; moreover, the body of{the Anointed}.

\v 19 and not [up]holding the head, out of{whom} the every body, through of{the junctions/points-of-connections} and of{bound-togethers[noun]}, being-supplied/provided-upon and being-step-ized-together, is-growing the grow-sis[i.e. state of growth] of{the God}.
\v 20 If you-die-off/away together-with to{the Anointed} from of{the in-line-withs} of{the world}, what[?] as being-alive in to{[the] world} you-are-being-esteem-effect/decree-ized/dogmatized[?]
\v 21 "You-may_not_take-hold "You-may_not_take-hold nor you-may-taste nor you-may-touch,"
\v 22 which[plural] it-is-being all into ruin to{the need-sis[i.e. state of need]-off/away[i.e. discarded]} according-to the command-effects and teaching-ias of{the men},
\v 23 the-which[plural] is-being by-contrast having word of{wisdom} in to{willed-ceremonial/ritual-observance-ia} and to{humble-prudent-ness} and to{without-spare-ia/license} of{body}, not in to{any value} toward filling[noun]/fulfillment/satiety of{the flesh}.
\c 3
\v 1 So, if you-are-roused-together to{the Anointed}, be-seeking the[plural] up/anew, where the Anointed is-being being-seated in to{right[hand]} of{the God}.
\v 2 Be-considering/deeming the[plural] up/anew, not the[plural] upon of{the earth},
\v 3 for you-die-off/away and the being-alive[noun] of{you} has-been-hidden together-with to{the Anointed} in to{the God}.
\v 4 When-supposing the Anointed may-be-revealed, the being-alive[noun] of{you}, then also you will-be-revealed together-with to{same} in to{esteem/glory}.

\v 6 through which the wrath of{the God} is-being-come upon the sons of{the unpersuade/stubborn/noncompliant-ia},
\v 7 in to{whom[plural]} also you walk-around at-what-time when you-have-been-being-alive in to{the-same[plural]}.
\v 8 Moreover, emphatically-now, place-off/away-selves, also you, all the wrath, [furious]desire, bad-ia, evil-assertion-ia, shameful-word-ia out of{the mouth} of{you}.
\v 9 Do_not_be-falsifying-selves Do_not_be-falsifying-selves into one-another, out-clothe[ing]/disrobe[ing]-off/away the old man together-with to{the practices} of{same}
\v 10 and clothe[ing]-selves the fresh/youthful/new, the being-up/anew-new-ed/renewed into knowledge-upon according-to [the] image of{the create[ing]} same,

\v 15 and the peace of{the Anointed}: be-prize-ing/umpiring in to{the hearts} of{you}, into which also you-are-called in to{one body}, and be-becoming well-favor-ful/thankful.
\v 16 The word of{the Anointed}: be-housing-in in to{you} richly in to{every wisdom}, teaching and placing-in-mind/exhorting sameselves to{psalms} and to{hymns} and to{spiritual songs} in to{grace/favor} singing in to{the heart} of{you} to{the Lord},
\v 17 and every which what supposing you-may-be-doing in to{word} or in to{work}, all in to{[the] name} of{[the] Lord Jesus}, well-favoring/giving-thanks to{the God and Father} through of{same}.

\v 23 which if-supposing you-may-be-doing out of{life}, be-work-izing-selves as to{the Lord} and not to{men},
\v 24 having-beheld that from of{[the] Lord} you-will-take-selves the opposite-give-off/away-sis[i.e. state of compensation in exchange] of{the inheritance}. To{the Lord Anointed} you-are-slaving,
