\v 1 Many-share-ly/portion-ly/part-ly and many-manner-ly long-ago the God, speak[ing] to{the fathers} in to{the prophets},
\v 2 upon of{last} of{the days, the-same}, speaks to{us} in to{[the] son}, whom he-places inheritor of{all}, through of{whom} also he-makes the eons,
\v 3 who, being splendor-off/away-effect/effulgence of{the esteem/glory} and engraver/impress of{the stand-under-sis[i.e. state of standing under]/understanding/substance} of{same}, besides carrying the all to{the say-effect/statement} of{the enablement/empowerment} of{same} through of{sameself}, make[ing]-self purging/cleansing[noun] of{the sins} of{us}, sits-down in to{right[hand]} of{the greatness} in to{high[plural]},
\v 4 to{the-which-the-same} become[ing] more-mastering/controlling[adjective] of{the messengers} to{as-much-as} [a] more-diverse/distinct/variant name he-has-inherited aside same[plural],
\v 5 for to{whom[?]} of{the messengers} he-says at-what-time[?], "You are-being Son of{me}; I, today, have-begotten you," and again, "I will-be to{same} into father and same will-be to{me} into son."[?]
\v 6 Moreover, when-supposing again he-may-lead-into, the first-offspring, into the housed/inhabited[noun], he-is-saying also, "All messengers of{God}: worship to{same}."
\v 7 Also on-one-hand, toward the messengers, he-is-saying, "The making the messengers of{same} breath-effects/blow-effects/winds/spirits and the employees of{same} [a] flame of{fire}."
\v 8 On-the-other-hand, toward the son, "The throne of{you}, the God, into the eon of{the eon}, staff of{straightness}, the staff of{the kingdom} of{you}.
\v 9 You-love justice-ness and hate lawless-ia. Through the-same, the God, the God of{you}, anoints you olive-oil of{exultation} beside the have-alongsides/partakers/sharers of{you},"
\v 10 and "You, according-to origins, Lord, foundation[verb] the earth, and the heavens are-being works of{the hands} of{you}.
\v 11 Same will-perish-off/away; moreover, you are-remaining-through, and all, as [an] outer-garment, will-be-old-ed,
\v 12 and as-if [a] cast/drape-around[i.e. headgear/wrapping/garment] you-will-turn-round-about/wrap same[plural] and they-will-be-altered; moreover, you are-being the same, and the years of{you} will_not_quit-out/exhaust."
\v 13 Moreover, toward whom[?] of{the messengers} he-has-said at-what-time[?], "Be-being-seated out of{right} of{me} until supposing I-may-place the[plural] hostile of{you} under-foot of{the feet} of{you}"[?]
\v 14 Emphatically-not[?] all are-being employ-ive spirits being-sent-off/away into service through the[plural] being-about to-be-inheriting salvation[?]
\c 2
\v 1 Through the-same, it-is-necessitating more-excessively us to-be-holding-toward to{the[plural] heard}, not-whereby we-would-flow-aside,
\v 2 for if the word spoken through of{messengers} becomes confirmed[adjective] and every step-aside-sis[i.e. state of stepping aside]/transgression and hearken-aside[noun] takes in-just[i.e. justified] give-wage-off/away-ia/remuneration/recompense,
\v 3 how[?] we will-flee-out/escape, unconcerned of{the-such-the-same salvation}[?], the-which, take[ing] origin to-be-being-spoken-to through of{the Lord}, is-confirmed under of{the[plural] hear[ing]} into us,
\v 4 of{the God witnessing-together-upon} both to{signs} and to{miracles} and to{various enablements/empowerments} and of{[the] Holy Spirit} to{divisions} according-to the will-sis[i.e. state of having willed] of{same},
\v 5 for not to{messengers} he-sets-under/subjects the being-inhabited[noun], the about-to-be-being about of{which} we-are-speaking.
\v 6 Moreover, somewhere someone witnesses/is-witnessed-through, saying, "What[?] is-being man, that you-are-being-reminded of{same}, or [the] son of{man}, that you-are-watching-upon same[?]
\v 7 You-diminish same some bit aside messengers to{esteem/glory} and to{value}; you-garland/crown same and stand/set-down same upon the works of{the hands} of{you}.
\v 8 You-set-under/subject all down-under of{the feet} of{same}," for in to{the} to-set-under/subject the all to{same}, he-lets-off/away nothing unset-under/un-subject/insubordinate to{same}. Moreover, now not-yet we-are-seeing the all having-been-set-under/subjected to{same}.
\v 9 Moreover, we-are-viewing Jesus, the having-been-diminished some bit aside messengers, through the suffer-effect of{the death} having-been-garlanded/crowned to{esteem/glory} and to{value}, which-how he-may-taste of{death} to{[the] grace/favor} of{God} over/for-the-sake of{every[one]},
\v 10 for it-has-been-fitting to{same}, through whom [are] the all[neuter] and through of{whom} [are] the all[neuter], lead[ing] many sons into esteem/glory, the originator of{the salvation} of{same[plural]}, to-accomplish through of{suffer-effects},
\v 11 for both the[singular] holy-izing and the[plural] being-holy-ized [are] all out of{one}, through which cause he-is_not_being-ashamed-upon to-be-calling same brothers,
\v 12 saying, "I-will-message-off/away the name of{you} to{the brothers} of{me}; in to{[the] midst} of{[the] out-calling} I-will-hymn-sing you,"
\v 13 and again, "I will-be having-had-confidence upon to{same}," and again, "Behold, I and the childlings which the God gives to{me}."
\v 14 So, upon-if he-has-common-ed the childlings of{blood} and of{flesh}, and same[singular] nearby-aside-ly/beside-ly he-has-across/partakes/shares of{the same[plural]}, in-which-place through of{the death} he-may-unemploy/idle/disuse the having the might of{the death}, the-same is-being the devil/slanderous,
\v 15 and may-alter-off/away the-same[plural], as-many-as to{fear} of{death} through of{every, the} to-be-being-alive, have-been-being liable of{slave-ia[i.e. slavery]},
\v 16 for where-at-this-juncture he-is_not_taking-upon of{messengers}; contrariwise, he-is-taking-upon of{sow-effect} [of-]Abraham,
\v 17 whence he-has-been-owing according-to all[neuter plural] to-be-likened to{the brothers}, in-which-place he-may-become merciful and faithful, [a] chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest], the[neuter plural] toward the God into the to-be-being-propitiated, the sins of{the people},
\v 18 for in to{which} he-has-suffered, same trial-ized, he-is-being-enabled/empowered to-help to{the[plural] being-trial-ized}.
\c 3
\v 1 Whence, holy brothers, have-alongsides/partakers/sharers of{upon-heavenly call-sis[i.e. state of calling]}, think-according-to/consider the sent-off[one] and chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] of{the same-word-ia/accordance/agreement} of{us}, Jesus,
\v 2 being faithful to{the do[ing]} same, as also Moses in to{the whole house} of{same},
\v 3 for the-same has-been-considered-worthwhile of{much-more esteem/glory} aside/beside Moses according-to as-much-as much-more value the equip-ize[ing]/furnish[ing] same is-having [than] of{the house},
\v 4 for every house is-being-equip-ized/furnished under of{someone}; moreover, the God [is] equip-ize[ing]/furnish[ing] the all,
\v 5 and Moses, on-one-hand, [is] faithful in to{the whole house} of{same} as [an] attendant into witness of{the[plural] will-be-spoken};
\v 6 on-the-other-hand, Anointed as Son upon the house of{same}, of{which} house we are-being, emphatically-if-supposing we-may-hold-down/according-to the all-say-ia and the boast-effect of{the expectation} up-to of{finish/completion} confirmed[adjective],
\v 7 through-which according-as the Spirit, the Holy, is-saying, "Today if-supposing you-may-hear of{the sound} of{same},
\v 8 you-should_not_be-hardening the hearts of{you} as in to{the beside-bitterness} according-to the day of{the trial-ization} in to{the desolate},
\v 9 of{which} the fathers of{you} trial-ize me in to{esteem-ization/evaluation/scrutiny} and behold the works of{me} forty years,
\v 10 through-which I-am-indignant/angry-toward to{the generation, the-there}, and say, 'Ever[i.e. over and over, continually] they-are-being-led-astray to{the heart}; moreover, same do_not_know the ways of{me},'
\v 11 as I-swear in to{the wrath} of{me} 'if they-will-be-come-into into the rest-down-sis[i.e. state of rest] of{me}.'"
\v 12 Be-viewing, brothers, not-whereby [an] evil heart of{unbelief} will-be in to{some} of{you} in to{the} to-stand-off/away from of{[the] being-alive God}.
\v 13 Contrariwise, be-calling-aside sameselves according-to each day even-to of{which} the is-being-called today, in-which-place someone out of{you} may_not_be-hardened to{deceit} of{the sin},
\v 14 for we-have-become have-alongsides/partakers/sharers of{the Anointed} emphatically-if-supposing we-may-hold-down/according-to the origin of{the stand-under-sis[i.e. state of standing under]} up-to confirmed[adjective] of{finish/completion},
\v 15 in to{the} to-be-being-said, "Today if-supposing you-may-hear of{the sound} of{same}, you-should_not_be-hardening the hearts of{you} as in to{the beside-bitterness},"
\v 16 for some hear[ing] beside-embitter; contrariwise, not all the come[ing]-out out of{Egypt} through of{Moses}.
\v 17 Moreover, to{whom[?]} he-is-indignant/angry-toward, forty years[?] Emphatically-not[?] to{the sin[ing]}, of{whom[plural]} the body-parts falls in to{the desolate}[?]
\v 18 Moreover, to{whom[?]} he-swears not to-will-be-come-into into the rest-down-sis[i.e. state of rest] of{same} if not to{the[plural] unpersuadable/stubborn/noncompliant}[?],
\v 19 and we-are-viewing that they-are_not_enabled to-come-into through unbelief.
\c 4
\v 1 So, we-should-fear, not-whereby of{message-upon-ia/declaration being-left-behind} to-come-into into the rest-down-sis[i.e. state of rest] of{same}, anyone out of{you} would-be-esteeming to-have-been-deficient,
\v 2 for also we-are-being having-been-good-message-ized even-according-as also-the-there-s; contrariwise, the word does_not_profit the-there-s of{the heard[noun]}, not having-been-blended-together to{the faith} to{the[plural] hear[ing]},
\v 3 for the[we] believe[ing] are-being-come-into into the rest-down-sis[i.e. state of rest] according-as he-has-said, "As I-swear in to{the wrath} of{me} if they-will-be-come-into into the rest-down-sis[i.e. state of rest] of{me}," and-to-which of{the works be[ing]-become} from of{[the] cast-down} of{[the] world},
\v 4 for he-has-said where about of{the seventh} the-same-ly, "And the God rests-down in to{the day, the seventh}, from of{all the works} of{same},"
\v 5 and in to{the-same} again, "If they-will-be-come-into into the rest-down-sis[i.e. state of rest] of{me}."
\v 6 So, upon-if/since it-is-being-left-off some to-come-into into same and the[plural] good-message-ized more-before do_not_come-into through unpersuade/stubborn/noncompliant-ia,
\v 7 again he-is-defining some day, "Today," in David saying alongside the-which-the-same time according-as it-has-been-said-before, "Today if-supposing you-may-hear of{the sound} of{same}, you-should_not_be-hardening the hearts of{you},"
\v 8 for if Joshua rests-down same, not supposing he-has-been-speaking about of{another day} alongside the-same.
\v 9 Consequently, [a] sabbatization is-being-left-off to{the people} of{the God},
\v 10 for the come[ing]-into into the rest-down-sis[i.e. state of rest] of{same}, also same rests-down from of{the works} of{same} even-as the God from of{the[plural] own}.
\v 11 So, we-should-expedite-ize/endeavor to-come-into into the-there, the rest-down-sis[i.e. state of rest], in-which-place not in to{the same show-effect-under/example} anyone would-fall of{the unpersuade/stubborn/noncompliant-ia},
\v 12 for the word of{the God} [is] being-alive and workable/active/operative and more-cutting/more-slicing/sharper/more-incisive over every double-edged knife and being-penetrated even-to of{division} both of{life} and of{spirit} both of{joints/junctures} and of{marrows} and judge-ive/ious/discerning/[translit. critic-al/critique-ous] of{in-desires} and of{in-mind/thinkings} of{heart},
\v 13 and [there]is_not_being [a] creation unrevealed[adjective] in-sight of{same}; moreover, all [are] naked and having-been-neck-ized[i.e. seized by the neck] to{the eyes} of{same}, toward whom to{us} [is] the word/account/reckoning.
\v 14 So, having [a] great chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] having-come-through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of{the God}, we-may-be-seizing/holding of{the same-word-ia/acknowledgement/accordance/agreement},
\v 15 for we-are_not_having [a] chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] not being-enabled to-suffer-together[translit. sym-path-ize] to{the weaknesses} of{us}; moreover, having-been-trial-ized according-to all, according-to likeness, apart-from of{sin}.
\v 16 So, alongside of{all-say-ia} we-may-be-being-come-toward to{the throne} of{the grace/favor}, in-which-place we-may-take mercy, and we-may-discover grace/favor into good-seasonly/opportune help/support,
\c 5
\v 1 for every chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] out of{men} being-taken over/for-the-sake of{men} is-being-stood/set-down the[neuter plural] toward the God, in-which-place he-may-be-toward-carrying both gifts and sacrifices over/for-the-sake of{sins},
\v 2 being-enabled to-be-measuring/moderating-passion to{the[plural] without-knowing and being-led-astray}, since also same[singular] is-being-lain-around weakness,
\v 3 and through same is-owing according-as about of{the people} the-same-ly and about of{sameself} to-be-toward-carrying about of{sins},
\v 4 and not to{sameself} anyone is-taking the value; contrariwise, the being-called under of{the God} even-according-as also the Aaron.
\v 5 The-same-ly also the Anointed esteem-izes/glorifies not sameself to-be-become chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]; contrariwise, the speak[ing] toward same, "Son of{me} you are-being. I today have-begotten you,"
\v 6 according-as also in to{different-other} he-is-saying, "You [are] consecrated[i.e. priest] into the eon according-to the set-sis[i.e. set state]/order/arrangement [of-]Melchizedek,"
\v 7 who in to{the days} of{the flesh} of{same}, both necessitations and supplications toward the being-enabled to-be-saving same out of{death}, alongside of{strong cry-out} and of{tears}, toward-carry[ing] and heard-into from of{the well-take-ia/discretion},
\v 8 even-also being Son he-learns from of{which[plural]} he-suffers the hearken-under[i.e. compliance]
\v 9 and, accomplished, he-becomes, to{all the[plural] hearkening-under[i.e. the compliant]} to{same[singular]}, cause of{eternal salvation},
\v 10 addressed-toward under of{the God} "chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]" according-to the set-sis[i.e. set state]/order/arrangement [of-]Melchizedek
\v 11 about of{whom} much to{us}, the word/account/reckoning, and hard-meaning-ive to-be-saying, since you-have-become indolent/sluggish/slow/dull to{the hearings},
\v 12 for and/also owing to-be-being teachers through the time, again you-are-having need of{the} to-be-teaching you what the[plural] in-line-withs of{the origin/original} of{the sayings} of{the God}, and you-have-become having need of{milk} and not of{firm/solid nourishment},
\v 13 for every, the having-across/partaking/sharing of{milk} [is] without-trial/untried/inexperienced of{word} of{justice-ness}, for he-is-being infant[adjective].
\v 14 Moreover, the firm/solid nourishment is-being of{the[plural] accomplished[i.e. mature]}, through the having[noun], of{having} the perception-faculties having-been-exercised toward discrimination both of{good} and of{bad},
\c 6
\v 1 through-which, let[ing]-off/away-from the word of{the origin/original} of{the Anointed} upon the accomplish-ness, we-may-be-being-carried not again casting-selves-down/according-to [a] foundation of{change-of-mind/thinking} from of{dead works} and of{faith} upon God,
\v 2 of{immersions}, of{teaching[noun]} both of{upon-place-sis[i.e. state of placing upon]} of{hands} and of{stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection]} of{dead}, and of{eternal judge-effect/judgment},
\v 3 and we-will-do the-same emphatically-if-supposing the God may-be-upon-turning,
\v 4 for unenabled, the[plural] once light-ized/illuminated, besides taste[ing] of{the gratuity, the upon-heavenly}, and be[ing]-become have-alongsides/partakers/sharers of{[the] Holy Spirit},
\v 5 and taste[ing] good say-effect of{God}, besides enablements/empowerments of{[the] about-to-be-being eon},
\v 6 and fall[ing]-beside again to-be-renew-izing into change-of-mind/thinking, crucifying-up/anew to{sameselves} the Son of{the God} and show-effect-izing-beside,
\v 7 for the land drink[ing] the often coming rain upon of{same} and offspring-ing well-placed vegetation to{the-there-s}, through whom also it-is-being-land-worked, is-taking-across/partaking of{good-word-ia} from of{the God};
\v 8 moreover, carrying-out/bearing thorn-bushes and thistles [is] un-esteem-able/disreputable/discredited/unapproved/unqualified and near of{curse-down/against}, of{which} the finish/completion [is] into burning-heat.
\v 9 Moreover, we-have-been-persuaded about of{you}, beloved, the[neuter plural] more-mastering/controlling[adjective] and being-had of{salvation} if also we-are-speaking the-same-ly,
\v 10 for the God [is] not unjust to-forget of{the work} of{you} and of{the love} of{which} you-show-yourselves-in into the name of{same}, serve[ing] to{the[plural] holy} and serving.
\v 11 Moreover, we-are-desiring-upon each of{you} the same, to-be-showing-selves-in expedience toward the full-carry-ia of{the expectation} even-to of{finish/completion},
\v 12 in-which-place you-may-become not indolent/sluggish/slow/dull; moreover, imitators of{the[plural] inheriting} through of{faith} and of{far-[furious]desire-ia[i.e. longsuffering]} the message-upon-ias/declarations,
\v 13 for the God, upon-message[ing] to{the} Abraham, since he-has-been-having according-to of{not-one greater} to-swear, he-swears according-to of{sameself},
\v 14 saying, "The assuredly, good-word-ing, I-will-good-word you, and, multiplying, I-will-multiply you,"
\v 15 and the-same-ly far-[furious]desire[ing][i.e. longsuffering], he-occurs-upon of{the message-upon-ia/declaration},
\v 16 for, on-one-hand, men are-swearing according-to of{the greater}, and of{every word-ia-in-place-of/in-opposition-to/contradiction} to{same[plural]} the oath [is] limit/end into confirmation,
\v 17 in to{which} the God, more-excessive, intending to-show-upon to{the inheritors} of{the message-upon-ia/declaration} the unalterable/immutable of{the intention} of{same}, mediates to{oath},
\v 18 in-which-place through two of{unalterable/immutable practice-effects} in to{which} unenabled[adjective], God to-falsify, we-may-be-having strong call-aside-sis[i.e. state of calling aside], the[plural] flee[ing]-down/according-to, to-seize of{the expectation being-lain-ahead},
\v 19 which we-are-having as [an] anchor of{the life}, both unfailing/unwavering/assured and confirmed[adjective], and being-come-into into the more-inside/within of{the spread-out-against-effect/curtain},
\v 20 which-where Jesus, [the] pre-course/forerunner over/for-the-sake of{us}, comes-into according-to the set-sis[i.e. set state]/order/arrangement [of-]Melchizedek, be[ing]-become chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] into the eon,
\c 7
\v 1 for the-same, the Melchizedek, king [of-]Salem, consecrated[i.e. priest] of{the God, the highest}, the meet[ing]-together Abraham to{returning} from of{the cutting[noun]} of{the kings} and good-word[ing] same,
\v 2 to{whom} also Abraham divides [a] tenth from of{all}; on-one-hand, first, is-being-meant "king of{justice-ness};" on-the-other-hand, upon-thereafter, also king [of-]Salem, which is-being "king of{peace},"
\v 3 without-father, without-mother, without-said/accounted/reckoned-generation/descent[i.e. no genealogy], having neither origin of{days} nor finish/completion of{being-alive[noun]}; moreover, having-been-likened-off/away[i.e. rendered/become like] to{the son} of{the God}, he-is-remaining consecrated[i.e. priest] into the through-carry/continuous/continual/perpetual.
\v 4 Moreover, you-are-observing how-statural/eminent the-same [is], to{whom} also Abraham, the patriarch, gives [a] tenth out of{the[plural] top-of-heap[i.e. first-fruits, best of spoils]},
\v 5 and on-one-hand, the[plural] out of{the sons} [of-]Levi, taking the consecrate-ia[i.e. priesthood], are-having command to-be-tenth-ing-off/away-from the people according-to the law; the-same[neuter singular] is-being the brothers of{same[plural]}, even-also having-come-out out of{the loin} [of-]Abraham.
\v 6 On-the-other-hand, the not being-said/accounted/reckoned-generated/descended[i.e. having genealogy] out of{same[plural]} has-tenth-ed the Abraham and has-good-word-ed the having the message-upon-ias/declarations.
\v 7 Moreover, apart-from of{every word-ia-in-place-of/in-opposition-to/contradiction} the less-than is-being-well-word-ed under of{the more-mastering/controlling[adjective]},
\v 8 and thus/here, on-one-hand, dying-off/away men are-taking tenths; on-the-other-hand, there being-witnessed that he-is-being-alive,
\v 9 and, as said[noun] to-say [i.e. "so to speak"], through Abraham also Levi, the taking tenths, has-been-tenth-ed,
\v 10 for he-has-been-being still in to{the loin} of{the father} when the Melchizedek meets-together to{same}.
\v 11 So, if, on-one-hand, accomplish-sis[i.e. state of accomplishment] has-been-being through of{the Levitical consecrated-ness[i.e. priestly nature]}, for the people has-been-law-placed upon of{same}, what[?] still need according-to the set-sis[i.e. set state]/order/arrangement [of-]Melchizedek [is a] different-other to-be-standing-up/anew consecrated[i.e. priest], and not according-to the set-sis[i.e. set state]/order/arrangement [of-]Aaron, to-be-being-said/accounted/reckoned[?],
\v 12 for of{the consecrated-ness[i.e. priestly nature] being-changed-place}, out of{compulsion} also change-place-sis[i.e. state of changing place] is-being-become of{law},
\v 13 for upon whom it-is-being-said/accounted/reckoned the-same[neuter plural], he-has-had-across/partaken/shared of{[a] different-other tribe} from of{which} not-one has-had/held-toward to{the sacrifice-place},
\v 14 for [it is] pre-evident that out of{Judah} the Lord of{us} has-completed-up/anew, into which tribe Moses speaks nothing about of{consecrated-ness[i.e. priestly nature]},
\v 15 and it-is-being evident-according-to more-excessive still if according-to the likeness [of-]Melchizedek [a] different-other consecrated[i.e. priest] is-being-stood-up/anew,
\v 16 who has-become not according-to law of{fleshy command}; contrariwise, according-to enablement/empowerment of{un-loose-down-ive/non-deconstructive/indissoluble being-alive[noun]},
\v 17 for he-is-being-witnessed that "you [are] consecrated[i.e. priest] into the eon according-to the set-sis[i.e. set state]/order/arrangement [of-]Melchizedek,"
\v 18 for, on-one-hand, un-place-sis[i.e. state of setting aside, discarding]/nullification/rejection is-being-become of{[the] leading-before/ahead command} through the of{same} weak and unprofitable,
\v 19 for the law accomplishes nothing; on-the-other-hand, [it is] [a] lead-upon-into/introduction of{[a] more-mastering/controlling[adjective] expectation} through of{which} we-are-becoming-near to{the God},
\v 20 and according-to as-much-as not apart-from of{oath-swear-ia}, for, on-one-hand, apart-from of{oath-swear-ia}, the consecrateds[i.e. priests] are-being having-become;
\v 21 on-the-other-hand, the alongside of{oath-swear-ia} through of{the saying} toward same, "[The] Lord swears and will_not_be-changed-concern. You [are] consecrated[i.e. priest] into the eon according-to the set-sis[i.e. set state]/order/arrangement [of-]Melchizedek."
\v 22 According-to the-which-the-same, Jesus has-become guarantee/security-ive[adjective] of{[a] more-mastering/controlling[adjective] through-placement/disposition/covenant},
\v 23 and, on-one-hand, the many-more are-being having-become consecrateds[i.e. priests], through the to{death} to-be-being-hindered to-be-remaining-beside.
\v 24 On-the-other-hand, the through the to-be-remaining, same, into the eon, is-having the without-stepping-aside consecrated-ness[i.e. priestly nature],
\v 25 whence also into the all-complete he-is-being-enabled/empowered to-be-saving the[plural] being-come-toward through of{same[singular]} to{the God}, always being-alive into the to-be-occurring-in over/for-the-sake of{same[plural]},
\v 26 for to-which-the-same to{us} it-has-been-fitting, [a] pious, without-bad, untainted/uncontaminated chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest], having-been-separated from of{the[plural] sinful} and be[ing]-become higher-than of{the heavens},
\v 27 who is_not_having according-to day [i.e. day by day] compulsion, even-as the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] more-before over/for-the-sake of{the own sins}, to-be-carrying-up sacrifices upon-thereafter of{the[plural]} of{the people}, for he-does the-same upon-once, carry[ing]-up sameself,
\v 28 for the law is-standing/setting-down men chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] having weakness; moreover, the word of{the oath-swear-ia, the} alongside the law having-been-accomplished, Son into the eon.
\c 8
\v 1 Moreover, head-gist upon to{the[plural] being-said}, we-are-having to-which-the-same chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] who sits-down in to{right[hand]} of{the throne} of{the greatness} in to{the heavens},
\v 2 employee of{the[plural] holy} and of{the tabernacle, the genuine}, which the Lord fastens/fixes and not man,
\v 3 for every chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] is-being-stood/set-down into the to-be-toward-carrying both gifts and sacrifices, whence compulsory to-be-having something also, the-same, which he-may-toward-carry,
\v 4 for, on-one-hand, if he-has-been-being upon of{[the] earth}, moreover-not supposing he-has-been-being consecrated[i.e. priest], of{being the[plural] toward-carrying} the gifts according-to the law,
\v 5 the-who[plural] to{show-effect-under/example} and to{shadow} are-rendering-employment of{the[plural] upon-heavenly} according-as Moses has-been-business-effect-ized, being-about to-be-completing-upon the tabernacle, for, "Be-seeing," he-is-asserting, "you-would-do all according-to the imprint/replica/type, the shown to{you} in to{the mountain}."
\v 6 Moreover, emphatically-now he-has-occurred of{more-diverse/distinct/variant employment} to{as-much-as} also it-is-being of{[a] more-mastering/controlling[adjective] through-placement/disposition/covenant}, which-what middleman/intermediary/mediator/arbitrator has-been-law-placed upon to{more-mastering/controlling[adjective] message-upon-ias/declarations},
\v 7 for if supposing the first, the-there, has-been-being blameless, not of{second} [a] place has-been-being-sought,
\v 8 for, blaming same[plural], he-is-saying, "'Behold, days are-being-come,' [the] Lord is-saying, 'and I-will-complete-together [a] new through-placement/disposition/covenant upon the house [of-]Israel and upon the house of{Judah},
\v 9 not according-to the through-placement/disposition/covenant which I-make to{the fathers} of{same[plural]} in to{[the] day} of{take[ing]-upon-self} of{same[plural]} of{the hand} of{me} to-lead-out same[plural] out of{[the] land} of{Egypt}, that same[plural] do_not_remain-in in to{the through-placement/disposition/covenant} of{me}, and-I am-unconcerned of{same[plural]},' [the] Lord is-saying,
\v 10 'that same, the through-placement/disposition/covenant, which I-will-through-place/disposition/covenant-such-as-to-be-through-placed/dispositioned/covenanted to{the house} [of-]Israel alongside the days, the-there-s,' [the] Lord is-saying, 'giving laws of{me} into the through-mind/thinking of{same[plural]} and I-will-write-upon upon [the] hearts of{same[plural]} same[plural] and I-will-be to{same[plural]} into God and same[plural] will-be to{me} into people,

\v 12 that I-will-be propitious to{the injustices} of{same}, and of{the sins} of{same} and of{the lawless-ias} of{same}, no, I-would_not_be-reminded still.'"
\v 13 In to{the} to-be-saying "new," he-has-old-ed the first; moreover, the being-old-ed and aging, near of{unreveal-ize-ity/disappearance/occultation}.
\c 9
\v 1 So, by-contrast, also the first has-been-having justice-effects of{employ-ia} besides the worldly holy,
\v 2 for the first tabernacle is-equip-ized/furnished in to{which} [are] both[3x] the lampstand and the table and the place-forth-sis[i.e. state of placing forth] of{the breads}, the-which is-being-said "holy."
\v 3 Moreover, alongside the second spread-out-against-effect/curtain [is] [a] tabernacle, the being-said "holy of{holy[plural]},"
\v 4 having golden fumigate[incense]-place/object/apparatus and the ark of{the through-placement/disposition/covenant} having-been-covered-around from-everywhere to{gold-piece} in to{which} [a] golden jar having the manna and the staff [of-]Aaron, the sprout[ing], and the flat/surfaces[i.e. tablets] of{the through-placement/disposition/covenant}.
\v 5 Moreover, up-over/above of{same} [are] cherubim of{esteem/glory}, shadowing-down the propitiation[place], about of{which} is_not_being now to-be-saying according-to part/portion.
\v 6 Moreover, the-same-ly, of{the-same[plural] having-been-equip-ized/furnished}, on-one-hand, the consecrateds[i.e. priests] are-being-into into the first tabernacle through of{every}, completing-upon the employ-ias;
\v 7 on-the-other-hand, into the second, once of{the same-year}, only the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest], not apart-from of{blood}, which he-is-toward-carrying over/for-the-sake of{sameself} and of{the ignorant-effects} of{the people},
\v 8 the-same of{evident-ing the Spirit, the Holy} not-yet to-have-been-revealed, the way of{the[plural] holy} still of{the first tabernacle having} stand-sis[i.e. state of standing],
\v 9 the-which [is] [a] parable into the season, the having-stood-in/instituted according-to which both gifts and sacrifices are-being-toward-carried, not being-enabled to-accomplish according-to behold-together-sis[i.e. state of beholding together]/conscience the rendering-employment,

\v 11 Moreover, Anointed, become[ing]-aside chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] of{the[plural] beneficial about-to-be-being} through of{the greater and more-accomplished tabernacle}, not of{hand-made}, the-same is-being, not of{the-same, the creation},
\v 12 nor through of{blood} of{[male]goats} and of{calves}; moreover, through of{the own blood}, comes-into upon-once into the[plural] holy, discover[ing]-self[i.e. obtaining for self] eternal loose-agent-sis/[state of]release,
\v 13 for if the blood of{bulls} and of{[male]goats} and ash of{tamer[i.e. bullock/heifer]} sprinkling the having-been-common-ed[i.e. vulgar/unclean] is-holy-izing toward the cleanness/purity of{the flesh},
\v 14 to{how-much[?]} more the blood of{the Anointed}, who through of{eternal Spirit} toward-carries sameself unblemished to{the God}, will-cleanse the behold-together-sis[i.e. state of beholding together]/conscience of{you} from of{dead works} into the to-be-rendering-employment to{[the] being-alive God}[?],
\v 15 and through the-same he-is-being middleman/intermediary/mediator/arbitrator of{[a] new through-placement/disposition/covenant}, which-how, of{death become} into loose-off/away-sis[i.e. state of being loosed off/away]/release-off/away of{the step-aside-sises[i.e. states of stepping aside]/transgressions} upon to{the first through-placement/disposition/covenant}, they-may-take the message-upon-ia/declaration, the[plural] having-been-called of{the eternal inheritance},
\v 16 for which-where [is] through-placement/disposition/covenant compulsion, death [is] to-be-being-carried of{the through-place[ing]/disposition[ing]/covenant[ing]-such-as-to-be-]be[ing]-through-placed/dispositioned/covenanted},
\v 17 for [a] through-placement/disposition/covenant upon to{dead[plural]} [is] confirmed[adjective], since not-whereby it-is-having-strength when the through-place[ing]/disposition[ing]/covenant[ing]-such-as-to-be-]be[ing]-through-placed/dispositioned/covenanted is-being-alive,
\v 18 whence neither the first has-been-new-ized-in apart-from of{blood},
\v 19 for of{every command spoken} according-to the law under of{Moses} to{all the people}, take[ing] the blood of{the calves and [male]goats} alongside of{water} and of{scarlet wool} and of{hyssop}, both same, the scrollet, and all the people, he-sprinkles,
\v 20 saying, "The-same, the blood of{the through-placement/disposition/covenant, which} the God commands toward you."
\v 21 Moreover, also the tabernacle and all the vessels of{the employment} he-sprinkles similarly to{the blood},
\v 22 and almost all is-being-cleansed in to{blood} according-to the law, and apart-from of{blood-pour-out-ia} let-off/away-sis[i.e. state of release] is_not_being-become.
\v 23 So, [it is] compulsion, on-one-hand, the show-effect-unders/examples/patterns of{the[plural]} in to{the heavens, the-same} to-be-being-cleansed; moreover, same[plural], the[plural] upon-heavenly, to{more-mastering/controlling[adjective] sacrifices} aside/beside the-same[plural],
\v 24 for Anointed comes-into, not into holy hand-mades, imprints/replicas/types-in-place-of of{the[plural] genuine}; contrariwise, into same, the heaven, now to-be-reveal-ized-in to{the face} of{the God} over/for-the-sake of{us},
\v 25 nor in-which-place often he-may-be-toward-carrying sameself, even-as the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] is-being-come-into into the[plural] holy according-to same-year in to{blood belonging-to-another},
\v 26 upon-if it-has-been-necessitating same often to-suffer from of{cast-down} of{[the] world}; moreover, now once upon summation of{the eons} he-has-been-revealed into un-place-sis[i.e. state of setting aside, discarding] of{sin} through of{the sacrifice} of{same},
\v 27 and according-to as-much-as it-is-being-lain-off/away to{the men} once to-die-off/away; moreover, alongside the-same, judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment],
\v 28 the-same-ly also the Anointed, once toward-carried into the of{many} to-carry-up/anew sins, out of{second} apart-from of{sin} will-be-seen to{the[plural] receiving-out-off/away}, same, into salvation,
\c 10
\v 1 for the law [is] having [a] shadow of{the beneficial about-to-be-being}, not same, the image of{the practice-effects} according-to same-year to{the same sacrifices}, which they-are-toward-carrying into the through-carry/continuous/continual/perpetual. They-are_not-yet-ever_being-enabled to-accomplish the[plural] being-come-toward,
\v 2 upon-if not, supposing [the] being-toward-carried end/cease-such-as-to-be-ended/ceased through the nothing to-be-having still behold-together-sis[i.e. state of beholding together]/conscience of{sins}, the rendering-employment, once having-been-cleansed.
\v 3 Contrariwise, in to{same[plural]} [is] remembrance-anew of{sins} according-to same-year,
\v 4 for [the] blood of{bulls} and of{[male]goats} [is] unenabled[adjective] to-be-lifting-off/away sins,
\v 5 through-which, being-come-into into the world, he-is-saying, "You-do_not_will sacrifice and carry-toward[i.e. offering]; moreover, [a] body you-fit-ize-down/adjust/equip-for-self to{me},
\v 6 you-do_not_well-esteem whole-burn-effects and about of{sin}.
\v 7 Then I-say, 'Behold, I-am-arriving in to{headlet} of{scrollet}. It-has-been-written about of{emphatically-me, the} to-do the will-effect of{you}, the God.'"
\v 8 More-up, saying that "sacrifice and carry-toward[i.e. offering] and whole-burn-effects and about of{sin} you-do_not_will, nor you-well-esteem," the-what according-to law are-being-toward-carried,
\v 9 then he-has-said, "Behold, I-am-arriving, of{the} to-do the will-effect of{you}, the God," he-is-lifting-up[i.e. removing/eliminating, doing away with] the first, in-which-place he-may-stand the second,
\v 10 in to{which will-effect}, having-been-holy-ized, we-are-being through of{the carry-toward[i.e. offering]} of{the body} of{the Jesus Anointed} upon-once,
\v 11 and, on-one-hand, every consecrated[i.e. priest] has-been-standing according-to day [i.e. day by day] being-employed and toward-carrying the same often sacrifices, the-what[plural] not-yet-ever are-being-enabled to-lift-around[i.e. eliminate, do away with, concerning] sins.
\v 12 On-the-other-hand, the-same toward-carry[ing] one sacrifice over/for-the-sake of{sins} into the through-carry/continuous/continual/perpetual sits-down in to{right[hand]} of{the God},
\v 13 receiving-out[i.e. waiting for] the remaining[neuter] until the[plural] hostile of{same} may-be-placed under-foot of{the feet} of{same},
\v 14 for to{one carry-toward[i.e. offering]} he-has-accomplished into the through-carry/continuous/continual/perpetual the[plural] being-holy-ized.
\v 15 Moreover, also the Spirit, the Holy, is-witnessing to{us}, for alongside the to-have-said,
\v 16 "'Same, the through-placement/disposition/covenant, which I-will-through-place/disposition/covenant-such-as-to-be-through-placed/dispositioned/covenanted toward same[plural] alongside the days, the-there-s,' [the] Lord is-saying, 'giving laws of{me} upon [the] hearts of{same} and upon of{the through-minds/thinkings} of{same} I-will-write-upon same,

\v 18 Moreover, which-where [is] let-off/away-sis[i.e. state of release] of{the-same[plural]}, not-still [is] carry-toward[i.e. offering] about of{sin}.
\v 19 So, brothers, having all-say-ia into the way-into of{the[plural] holy} in to{the blood} of{Jesus},
\v 20 which he-new-izes-in to{us} [the] slaughter-ahead[i.e. already sacrificed] way, and being-alive through of{the spread-out-against-effect/curtain}, the-same is-being of{the flesh} of{same},

\v 22 we-may-be-being-come-toward alongside of{genuine heart} in to{full-carry-ia} of{faith} having-been-sprinkled the hearts from of{evil behold-together-sis[i.e. state of beholding together]/conscience} and having-been-bathed the body to{clean water}.
\v 23 We-should-be-having/holding-down/according-to the unleaning same-word-ia/accordance/agreement of{the expectation}, for the message[ing]-self-upon/declared-self-upon [is] faithful,

\v 25 not leaving-in-down/against/leaving-behind the gather-upon[noun] of{sameselves} according-as [is] custom to{some}; contrariwise, calling-aside, and to{the-which-the-same} more to{as-much-as} you-are-viewing the day becoming-near,
\v 26 for of{us sinning} purposefully/wittingly/voluntarily alongside the to-take the knowledge-upon of{the truth}, not-still sacrifice is-being-left-off about of{sins};
\v 27 moreover, what fearful reception-out of{judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]}, and of{fire}, zeal of{being-about} to-be-eating the[plural] under-in-in-place-of/subcontrary/contradictory/incongruous.
\v 28 Anyone un-place[ing]/reject[ing] [the] law of{Moses} is-dying-off/away apart-from of{compassions}, upon to{two or three witnesses}.
\v 29 To{how-much[?]} you-are-esteeming of{worse} the will-be-esteemed-worthy of{vengeance}, walk[ing]-down/against[i.e. trampling] the Son of{the God} and the blood of{the through-placement/disposition/covenant}, guide[ing]/direct[ing]/decree[ing] common[i.e. vulgar/unclean] in to{which} he-is-holy-ized, and rampage[ing]-in the Spirit of{the grace/favor}[?],

\v 31 Fearful the to-fall-in into [the] hands of{[the] being-alive God}.
\v 32 Moreover, be-reminding-selves-anew the more-before days in to{which}, light-ized/illuminated, you-remain-under much contest-sis[i.e. state of contest] of{suffer-effects};

\v 34 for also you-suffer-together[translit. sym-path-ize] to{the bound/captives} of{me}, and alongside of{joy} you-receive-toward-selves the snatching[adjective] of{the[neuter plural] originating-under/undertaking} of{you}, knowing to-be-having in to{sameselves} [a] more-mastering/controlling[adjective] undertaking[noun] in to{[the] heavens} and remaining.
\v 35 So, you-should_not_cast-off/away the all-say-ia of{you}, the-which is-having large give-wage-off/away-ia/remuneration/recompense,
\v 36 for you-are-having need of{remain-under-ance/perseverance}, in-which-place, do[ing] the will-effect of{the God}, you-may-attend-ize-selves the message-upon-ia/declaration,
