\c 3
\v 1 Already, beloved, I-am-writing the-same second send-upon[i.e. communication] to{you}, in to{which[plural]} I-am-rousing-through of{you} in to{remind-under-sis[i.e. state of remembering under]} the sincere through-mind/thinking

\v 3 knowing the-same, first, that infantilizers will-be-come upon of{the last days} in to{infantilization} according-to the own desire-upon-ias of{same}, being-gone
\v 4 and saying, "Where[?] is-being the message-upon-ia/declaration of{the presence} of{same}[?], for, from of{which} the fathers are-slept, all the-same-ly is-remaining-through from of{origin} of{creation},"
\v 5 for the-same is-escaping-notice same[plural], [plural]will-ing, that [the] heavens have-been-being out-old-ly and [the] land having-stood-together out of{water} and through of{water} to{the word} of{the God},
\v 6 through of{which[plural]} the then world, deluged to{water}, perishes-off/away.
\v 7 Moreover, the now heavens and the earth, to{the same word}, having-been-wealth-ized, are-being being-kept to{fire} into [the] day of{judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment]} and of{destruction/perishment-off/away-ia} of{the undevoted[adjective] men}.
\v 8 Moreover, one the-same: be_not_escaping-notice you, beloved, that one day beside to{[the] Lord} as [a] thousand years and [a] thousand years as one day.
\v 9 [The] Lord is_not_being-slow of{the message-upon-ia/declaration}, as some are-governing/directing/mandating/decreeing slowness; contrariwise, he-is-far-[furious]desire-ing[i.e. longsuffering] into you, not intending any to-perish-off/away; contrariwise, to-make-space [for] all into change-of-mind/thinking.
\v 10 Moreover, the day of{[the] Lord} will-arrive as [a] thief, in to{which} the heavens rushing-motion-sound-ly/buzzing-ly/humming-ly/whizzing-ly/hissing-ly/whistling-ly/rumbling-ly/rasping-ly[i.e. some sound of motion] will-pass-by-such-as-to-be-passed-by; moreover, in-line-withs, being-burned, will-be-loosed, and [the] earth and the works in to{same} will-be-burned-down.
\v 11 So, of{the-same all being-loosed}, it-is-necessitating when-where/what-manner you to-be-undertaking in to{holy turn-anew/conversions} and to{good-devotions},
\v 12 esteeming-toward/anticipating and hastening the presence of{the day} of{the God}, through which [the] heavens, being-inflamed, will-be-loosed and in-line-withs, being-burned, is-being-melted/dissolved.
\v 13 Moreover, we-are-esteeming-toward/anticipating new heavens and new earth according-to the message-effect-upon of{same} in to{which[plural]} justice-ness is-housing-down,
\v 14 through-which, beloved, esteeming-toward/anticipating the-same[plural], expedite-ize/endeavor without-spot/mark-ible and unblemished to-be-discovered to{same} in to{peace},
\v 15 and be-governing/guiding/directing/mandating/decreeing the far-[furious]desire-ia[i.e. longsuffering] salvation of{the Lord} of{us}, according-as also the beloved brother of{us}, Paul, writes to{you} according-to the wisdom given to{same},
\v 16 as also in to{all the send-upons[i.e. communications]}, speaking in to{same[plural]} about of{the-same[plural]} in to{which[plural]} some is-being difficult-mind/thought-ive[i.e. hard to understand/comprehend], which the unlearned and unestablished/unstable are-twisting/wrenching, as also the remaining scriptures toward the own destruction/loss/perishment-off/away-ia of{same[plural]}.
\v 17 So, you, beloved, knowing-before, be-guarding-selves, in-which-place not to{the astray} of{the illicitnesses}, led-off/away-together, you-may-fall-out of{the own establishment/stability}.
\v 18 Moreover, be-growing in to{grace/favor} and to{knowledge} of{the Lord of{us} and savior, Jesus Anointed}. To{same} the esteem/glory and now and into [the] day of{eon}. Amen.
