<verse style="v" number="4" />In to{same} being-alive[noun] has-been-being, and the being-alive[noun] has-been-being the light of{the men},
<verse style="v" number="5" />and the light is-revealing in to{the darkness-ia}, and the darkness-ia does_not_take-according-to same.
<verse style="v" number="6" />[A] man is-become, having-been-sent-off/away beside of{God}, name to{same} &quot;John.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="7" />The-same comes into witness-ia, in-which-place he-may-witness about of{the light}, in-which-place all may-believe through of{same}.

<verse style="v" number="12" />Moreover, as-many-as take same he-gives to{same} authority to-become offsprings of{God} to{the believing/entrusting} into the name of{same},
<verse style="v" number="13" />who, not out of{bloods}, nor out of{will-effect} of{flesh}, nor out of{will-effect} of{[a] man}; contrariwise, out of{God} are-begotten,
<verse style="v" number="14" />and the word becomes flesh, and tents/lodges/tabernacles in to{us}, and we-spectate the esteem/glory of{same}, as esteem/glory of{only-begotten} aside/beside/near of{[the] Father}, full of{grace/favor} and of{truth}.
<verse style="v" number="15" />John is-witnessing about of{same}, and has-cried-out, saying, &quot;The-same has-been-being whom I-say the behind of{me}, being-come, in-front of{me} has-become, that first of{me} he-has-been-being,&quot;

<verse style="v" number="20" />and he-acknowledges, and does_not_deny, and acknowledges that &quot;I am_not_being the Anointed,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="21" />and they-ask same, &quot;So, what[?] Elijah you are-being[?],&quot; and he-is-saying, &quot;I-am_not_being.&quot; &quot;The prophet you are-being[?],&quot; and he-responds, &quot;Not.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />So, they-say to{same}, &quot;Who[?] you-are-being, in-which-place we-may-give response to{the dispatch[ing]} us[?] What[?] you-are-saying about of{yourself}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="23" />He-has-been-asserting, &quot;I, &apos;Sound of{crying} in to{the desolate}. Straighten the way of{[the] Lord},&apos;[&quot;] according-as Isaiah the prophet says,[&quot;]
<verse style="v" number="24" />and the having-been-sent-off/away have-been-being out of{the Pharisees},
<verse style="v" number="25" />and they-ask same and say to{same}, &quot;So, what[?] you-are-immersing if you are_not_being the Anointed nor Elijah nor the prophet[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="26" />The John responds to{same}, saying, &quot;I am-immersing in to{water}; moreover, midst of{you} has-stood whom you have_not_beheld.

<verse style="v" number="31" />and-I had_not_beheld same; contrariwise, in-which-place it-may-be-revealed to{the Israel} through the-same, I come in to{water} immersing,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="32" />and John witnesses, saying that &quot;I-have-spectated the spirit descending as-if [a] pigeon/dove out of{heaven} and he-stays upon same,
<verse style="v" number="33" />and-I had_not_beheld same; contrariwise, the dispatch[ing] me to-be-immersing in to{water}, the-there says to{me}, &apos;Upon whom supposing you-may-behold the spirit descending and staying upon same, the-same is-being the immersing in to{[the] Holy Spirit},&apos;
<verse style="v" number="34" />and-I have-seen and have-witnessed that the-same is-being the Son of{the God}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="35" />To{the} upon-the-next-day again the John had-stood, and two out of{the disciples} of{same}
<verse style="v" number="36" />and, view[ing]-in to{the Jesus walking-around}, he-is-saying, &quot;Behold, the lamb of{the God},&quot;
<verse style="v" number="37" />and the two disciples hear of{same speaking} and accompany to{the Jesus}.
<verse style="v" number="38" />Moreover, turned, the Jesus, also spectate[ing] same accompanying, is-saying to{same}, &quot;What[?] you-are-seeking[?]&quot; Moreover, the say to{same}, &quot;Rabbi,&quot; the is-being-said is-being-meant &quot;Teacher,&quot; &quot;Where[?] you-are-staying[?]&quot;

<verse style="v" number="42" />and he-leads same toward the Jesus. Moreover, view[ing]-in to{same}, the Jesus says, &quot;You are-being Simon, the son of{Jona}. You will-be-called Cephas,&quot; which is-being-meant &quot;rock.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="43" />To{the} upon-the-next-day, he-wills to-come-out into the Galilee, and is-discovering Philip, and the Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Be-accompanying to{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="44" />Moreover, the Philip has-been-being from Bethsaida, out of{the city} of{Andrew} and of{Peter}.

<verse style="v" number="47" />The Jesus beholds the Nathanael being-come toward same and is-saying about of{same}, &quot;Behold truly [an] Israelite in to{whom} bait is_not_being.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="48" />Nathanael is-saying to{same}, &quot;Whence you-are-knowing me[?]&quot; Jesus responds and says to{same}, &quot;Before of{the} Philip to-sound you, being under the fig-tree, I-behold you.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="49" />Nathanael responds and is-saying to{same}, &quot;Rabbi, you are-being the Son of{the God}. You are-being the king of{the} Israel.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="50" />Jesus responds and says to{same} that &quot;I-say to{you}, I-behold you down-under of{the fig-tree}. You-are-believing. You-will-see greater of{the-same},&quot;
<verse style="v" number="51" />and he-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} from presently you-will-see the heaven having-been-opened-up and the messengers of{the God} ascending and descending upon the son of{the man},&quot;</para>

  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />and to{the day, the third} [a] wedding becomes in Cana of{the Galilee}, and the mother of{the Jesus} has-been-being there.
<verse style="v" number="2" />Moreover, also the Jesus is-called, and the disciples of{same}, into the wedding,
<verse style="v" number="3" />and of{wine be[ing]-deficient}, the mother of{the Jesus} is-saying toward same, &quot;They-are_not_having wine,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="4" />and the Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;What[?] to{emphatically-me} and to{you}, woman[?] Not-yet the hour of{me} has-arrived.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="5" />The mother of{same} is-saying to{the servants}, &quot;Which what[?] supposing he-may-be-saying to{you}, do.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="6" />Moreover, six stone water-vessels have-been-being there, being-lain according-to the cleansing of{the Judeans}, making-space-for up/anew two or three measures.
<verse style="v" number="7" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Fill-ize the water-vessels of{water},&quot; and they-fill-ize same until up,
<verse style="v" number="8" />and he-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Draw/drain now and be-carrying to{the chief-three[wall]-couch-er/chief-triclinium[Roman term]},&quot; and they-carry.
<verse style="v" number="9" />Moreover, as the chief-three[wall]-couch-er/chief-triclinium[Roman term] tastes the water having-become wine, and he-had_not_beheld whence it-is-being; moreover, the servants had-beheld the having-been-drawn/drained the water, the chief-three[wall]-couch-er/chief-triclinium[Roman term] is-sounding the bridegroom,
<verse style="v" number="10" />and is-saying to{same}, &quot;Every man first is-placing the good wine, and when-supposing they-may-be-drunk, then the inferior. You have-kept the good wine until presently.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="11" />The Jesus does the-same origin of{the signs} in to{Cana} of{the Galilee}, and reveals the esteem/glory of{same}, and the disciples of{same} believe/entrust into same.
<verse style="v" number="12" />Alongside the-same[neuter], same descends into Capernaum, and the mother of{same} and the brothers of{same} and the disciples of{same} also stay there not many days,
<verse style="v" number="13" />and the passover of{the Judeans} has-been-being near, and the Jesus ascends into Jerusalem,
<verse style="v" number="14" />and he-discovers in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} the selling oxen and sheep and pigeons/doves, and the cash-change-makers being-seated,
<verse style="v" number="15" />and, make[ing] [a] whip out of{rush-cordlets/ropelets}, he-casts-out all out of{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, both the sheep and the oxen, and of{the money-changers} he-pours-out the cash and turns-up the tables,
<verse style="v" number="16" />and to{the selling} the pigeons/doves he-says, &quot;Lift the-same from-here. Do_not_be-making the house of{the father} of{me} [a] house of{market/trade/commerce/emporium}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="17" />Moreover, the disciples of{same} remember that it-is-being having-been-written, &quot;The zeal of{the house} of{you} will-eat-down[i.e. consume] me.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="18" />So, the Judeans respond and say to{same}, &quot;What[?] sign you-are-showing to{us} that you-are-doing the-same[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="19" />Jesus responds and says to{same}, &quot;Loose the temple, the-same, and in to{three days} I-will-rouse same.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="20" />So, the Judeans say, &quot;To{forty and six years} the temple, the-same, is-house-built, and you in to{three days} will-rouse same[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="21" />Moreover, the-there has-been-saying about of{the temple} of{the body} of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="22" />So, when he-is-roused out of{dead}, the disciples of{same} remember that he-has-been-saying the-same and believe to{the scripture} and to{the word which} the Jesus says.
<verse style="v" number="23" />Moreover, as he-has-been-being in to{Jerusalems} in to{the passover} in to{the festival}, many believe into the name of{same}, observing of{same} the signs which he-has-been-doing.
<verse style="v" number="24" />Moreover, same, the Jesus, has_not_been-entrusting sameself to{same[plural]} through the same[singular] to-be-knowing all,

<verse style="v" number="4" />The Nicodemus is-saying toward same, &quot;How[?] [a] man is-being-enabled to-be-begotten being old-age[?] He-is_not_being-enabled to-come-into into the cavity-ia of{the mother} of{same} second[ly] and to-be-begotten.&quot;

<verse style="v" number="6" />The having-been-begotten out of{the flesh} is-being flesh and the having-been-begotten out of{the spirit} is-being spirit.
<verse style="v" number="7" />You-should_not_marvel that I-say to{you} it-is-necessitating you to-be-begotten up/anew-place-ly.

<verse style="v" number="9" />Nicodemus responds and says to{same}, &quot;How[?] the-same is-being-enabled to-become[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="10" />Jesus responds and says to{same}, &quot;You are-being the teacher of{the} Israel and you-are_not_knowing the-same[plural].

<verse style="v" number="19" />Moreover, the-same is-being the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment], that the light has-come into the world, and the men love more the darkness than the light, for the works of{same} has-been-being evil,
<verse style="v" number="20" />for every, the practicing insignificant/unimportant/mediocre/careless/indifferent/negligible, is-hating the light and is_not_being-come toward the light in-which-place the works of{same} would_not_be-confuted.

  <chapter style="c" number="4" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />So, as the Lord knows that the Pharisees hear that Jesus is-making and is-immersing much-more disciples than John,

<verse style="v" number="22" />You[plural] are-worshiping what you-have_not_beheld. We are-worshiping what we-have-beheld, that the salvation is-being out of{the Judeans}.
<verse style="v" number="23" />Contrariwise, [an] hour is-being-come and now is-being when the genuine worshipers will-worship to{the Father} in to{spirit} and to{truth}, for also the Father is-seeking to-whom-the-same[plural], the worshiping same

<verse style="v" number="28" />So, the woman lets-off/away the water-vessel of{same}, and comes-off/away into the city, and is-saying to{the men},

<verse style="v" number="44" />for same Jesus witnesses that [a] prophet in to{the own fatherland} is_not_having value.
<verse style="v" number="45" />So, when he-comes into the Galilee, the Galileans receive same, having-seen all as-much-as he-does in to{Jerusalems} in to{the festival}, for also same come into the festival.
<verse style="v" number="46" />So, again the Jesus comes into the Cana of{the Galilee}, which-where he-makes the water wine, and has-been-being some royal of{whom} the son has-been-being-infirm in Capernaum.

<verse style="v" number="42" />and they-have-been-saying, &quot;Not[?] the-same is-being Jesus, the son [of-]Joseph, of{whom} we have-beheld the father and the mother[?] So, how[?] he-is-saying that &apos;out of{the heaven} I-have-descended[?]&apos;&quot;
<verse style="v" number="43" />So, the Jesus responds and says to{same}, &quot;Do_not_be-murmuring/muttering/grumbling alongside of{one-another}.
<verse style="v" number="44" />Not-one is-being-enabled to-come toward me if-supposing, no, the Father, the dispatch[ing] me, may-pull same, and I will-stand-up/anew same in to{the last day}.
<verse style="v" number="45" />It-is-being having-been-written in to{the prophets}, &apos;And all will-be taught[adjective] of{God},&apos; so, every, the hear[ing] beside of{the Father} and learn[ing] is-being-come toward me.
<verse style="v" number="46" />Not that anyone has-seen the Father, if not the being beside of{the God}. The-same has-seen the Father.
<verse style="v" number="47" />Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, the believing/entrusting into emphatically-me is-having eternal being-alive[noun].
<verse style="v" number="48" />I am-being the bread of{the being-alive[noun]}.
<verse style="v" number="49" />The fathers of{you} eat the manna in to{the desolate} and they-die-off/away.
<verse style="v" number="50" />The-same is-being the bread, the out of{the heaven} descending, in-which-place who out of{same} may-eat and would_not_die-off/away.
<verse style="v" number="51" />I am-being the bread, the being-alive, the out of{the heaven} descend[ing]. If-supposing anyone may-eat out of{the-same, the bread}, he-will-be-alive into the eon, and the bread, moreover, which I will-give, is-being the flesh of{me}, which I will-give, over/for-the-sake of{the being-alive[noun]} of{the world}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="52" />So, the Judeans have-been-fighting toward one-another, saying, &quot;How[?] is-being-enabled, the-same, to-give to{us} the flesh to-eat[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="53" />So, the Jesus says to{same}, &quot;Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, if-supposing, no, you-would-eat the flesh of{the son} of{the man} and would-drink of{same} the blood, you-are_not_having being-alive[noun] in to{sameselves}.
<verse style="v" number="54" />The munching the flesh of{me} and drinking the blood of{me} is-having eternal being-alive[noun], and I will-stand-up/anew same in to{the last day},
<verse style="v" number="55" />for the flesh of{me} is-being true eat-up-sis[i.e. state of eating up] and the blood of{me} is-being true drink-sis[i.e. state of drinking].
<verse style="v" number="56" />The munching the flesh of{me} and drinking the blood of{me} is-remaining in to{emphatically-me}, and-I in to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="57" />According-as the being-alive Father sends-off/away me, also-I am-being-alive through the Father, and the munching me, also-the-there will-be-alive through emphatically-me.
<verse style="v" number="58" />The-same is-being the bread, the out of{the heaven} descend[ing], not according-as the fathers of{you} eat the manna and die-off/away. The munching the-same, the bread, will-be-alive into the eon.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="59" />He-says the-same in to{[a] gathering[translit. &quot;synagogue&quot;]}, teaching in Capernaum.
<verse style="v" number="60" />So, many hear[ing] out of{the disciples} of{same} say, &quot;The-same, the word, is-being hard. Who[?] is-being-enabled of{same} to-be-hearing[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="61" />Moreover, the Jesus having-beheld in to{sameself} that the disciples of{same} are-murmuring/muttering/grumbling about of{the-same}, says to{same}, &quot;The-same is-scandalizing you.
<verse style="v" number="62" />So, if-supposing you-may-be-observing the son of{the man} ascending which-where the more-before he-has-been-being[?]
<verse style="v" number="63" />The spirit is-being the making-alive; the flesh is_not_profiting, nothing. The say-effects/statements which I have-spoken to{you}, spirit is-being and being-alive[noun] is-being;
<verse style="v" number="64" />contrariwise, some out of{you} are-being, who are_not_believing,&quot; for the Jesus had-beheld out of{origin} some are-being the not believing, and who is-being the will-give[ing]-aside/deliver[ing] same,
<verse style="v" number="65" />and he-has-been-saying, &quot;Through the-same I-have-said to{you} that not-one is-being-enabled to-come toward me if-supposing it-may_not_be-being having-been-given to{same} out of{the Father} of{me}.
<verse style="v" number="66" />Out of{the-same}, many of{the disciples} of{same} come-off/away into the behind and not-still have-been-walking-around alongside of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="67" />So, the Jesus says to{the} twelve, &quot;No, also you are-will-ing to-be-withdrawing[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="68" />Simon Peter responds to{same}, &quot;Lord, toward whom[?] we-will-come-off/away[?] You-are-having [the] say-effects/statements of{eternal being-alive[noun]},
<verse style="v" number="69" />and we have-believed and have-known that you are-being the Anointed, the Son of{the God, the being-alive}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="70" />The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;Not[?] I choose you, the twelve[?], and out of{you} one is-being [a] devil/slanderous.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="71" />Moreover, he-has-been-saying the Judas of{Simon Iscariot}, for the-same has-been-being-about to-be-giving-aside/delivering same, one being out of{the twelve},</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="7" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />and the Jesus has-been-walking-around alongside the-same[neuter] in to{the Galilee}, for he-has_not_been-will-ing to-be-walking-around in to{the Judea}, that the Judeans have-been-seeking same to-kill-off/away.
<verse style="v" number="2" />Moreover, the festival of{the Judeans}, the tent-pitching-ia/booth-making-ia, has-been-being near.
<verse style="v" number="3" />So, the brothers of{same} say toward same, &quot;Step-across from-here and be-withdrawing into the Judea, in-which-place also the disciples of{you} may-observe the works of{you} which you-are-doing,
<verse style="v" number="4" />for not-one is-doing anything in to{hidden[adjective]}, and same is-seeking to-be-being in to{all-say-ia}. If you-are-doing the-same, reveal yourself to{the world},&quot;
<verse style="v" number="5" />for neither the brothers of{same} have-been-believing/entrusting into same.
<verse style="v" number="6" />So, the Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;The season, the mine, not-yet is-being-beside/present; moreover, the season, the yours, always is-being ready.
<verse style="v" number="7" />The world is_not_being-enabled to-be-hating you; moreover, it-is-hating emphatically-me, that I am-witnessing about of{same}, that evil is-being the works of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="8" />You, ascend into the festival; I not-yet am-ascending into the festival, the-same, that the my season not-yet has-been-fulfilled.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="9" />Moreover, say[ing] the-same to{same}, he-stays in to{the Galilee}.
<verse style="v" number="10" />Moreover, as the brothers of{same} ascend, then also same ascends into the festival, not revealingly; contrariwise, as in to{hidden[adjective]}.
<verse style="v" number="11" />So, the Judeans have-been-seeking same in to{the festival} and have-been-saying, &quot;Where[?] is-being the-there[?],&quot;
<verse style="v" number="12" />and much murmuring/muttering/grumbling[noun] has-been-being about of{same} in to{the crowds}, the on-one-hand have-been-saying that he-is-being beneficial; on-the-other-hand, others have-been-saying, &quot;Contrariwise, not. He-is-leading-astray the crowd.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="13" />Nevertheless, not-one has-been-speaking to{all-say-ia} about of{same} through the fear of{the Judeans}.
<verse style="v" number="14" />Moreover, already of{the festival being-midway}, the Jesus ascends into the consecrated[i.e. temple] and has-been-teaching.
<verse style="v" number="15" />So, the Judeans have-been-marveling, saying, &quot;How[?] the-same has-beheld write-effects, not having-learned[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="16" />The Jesus responds to{same} and says, &quot;The my teaching is_not_being mine; contrariwise, of{the dispatch[ing]} me.
<verse style="v" number="17" />If-supposing anyone may-be-will-ing to-be-doing the will-effect of{same}, he-will-know about of{the teaching}, whether it-is-being out of{the God} or I am-speaking from of{myself}.
<verse style="v" number="18" />The speaking from of{sameself} is-seeking the esteem/glory, the own/self; moreover, the seeking same, the esteem/glory of{the dispatch[ing]}, the-same is-being true, and injustice in to{same} is_not_being.
<verse style="v" number="19" />Not[?] Moses has-given to{you} the law[?], and not-one out of{you} is-doing the law. What[?] you-are-seeking me to-kill-off/away[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="20" />The crowd responds and says, &quot;You-are-having demon. Who[?] is-seeking you to-kill-off/away[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="21" />Jesus responds and says to{same}, &quot;I-do one work and all are-marveling.
<verse style="v" number="22" />Through the-same, Moses has-given to{you} the circumcision, not that out of{the Moses} it-is-being; contrariwise, out of{the fathers}, and in to{[the] sabbath} you-are-circumcising [a] man,
<verse style="v" number="23" />if [a] man is-taking circumcision in to{[the] sabbath}, in-which-place the law of{Moses} would_not_be-loosed, to{emphatically-me} you-are-being-galled that I-make [a] whole man healthy in to{[the] sabbath}.
<verse style="v" number="24" />Be_not_judging according-to sight-sis[i.e. state of seeing/sight]; contrariwise, judge the just judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment].&quot;
<verse style="v" number="25" />So, some out of{the Jerusalemites} have-been-saying, &quot;Not[?] the-same is-being whom they-are-seeking to-kill-off/away[?],
<verse style="v" number="26" />and, behold, to{all-say-ia} he-is-speaking, and they-are-saying nothing to{same}, not-whereby truly the chiefs know that the-same is-being the Anointed[?]
<verse style="v" number="27" />Contrariwise, we-have-beheld the-same, whence he-is-being; moreover, the Anointed, when-supposing he-may-be-being-come, no-one is-knowing whence he-is-being.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="28" />So, the Jesus cries-out, teaching in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} and saying, &quot;You-have-beheld also-me and have-beheld whence I-am-being, and from of{myself} I-have_not_come; contrariwise, the dispatch[ing] me is-being genuine, whom you have_not_beheld.
<verse style="v" number="29" />Moreover, I have-beheld same, that beside of{same} I-am-being, and-the-there sends-off/away me.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="30" />So, they-have-been-seeking same to-grab-hold-of, and no-one upon-casts the hand upon same, that not-yet the hour of{same} had-come.
<verse style="v" number="31" />Moreover, many out of{the crowd} believe/entrust into same and have-been-saying, &quot;The Anointed, when-supposing he-may-come, will-do not many-more signs of{what} the-same does.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="32" />The Pharisees hear the-same of{the crowd murmuring/muttering/grumbling} about of{same}, and the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the Pharisees send-off/away subordinates in-which-place they-may-grab-hold-of same.
<verse style="v" number="33" />So, the Jesus says to{same}, &quot;Still little time alongside of{you} I-am-being, and I-am-withdrawing toward the dispatch[ing] me.
<verse style="v" number="34" />You-will-seek me and you-will_not_discover, and which-where I am-being you are_not_being-enabled to-come.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="35" />So, the Judeans say toward sameselves, &quot;Where[?] the-same is-being-about to-be-being-gone, that we will_not_discover same[?] Not into the sow-through/dispersion of{the Greeks} he-is-being-about to-be-being-gone and to-be-teaching the Greeks[?]
<verse style="v" number="36" />What[?] is-being the-same, the word, which he-says, &apos;You-will-seek me and you-will_not_discover, and which-where I am-being you are_not_being-enabled to-come.&apos;[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="37" />Moreover, in to{the last day, the great} of{the festival}, the Jesus had-stood and cries-out, saying, &quot;If-supposing anyone may-be-thirsting: be-being-come toward me and be-drinking.
<verse style="v" number="38" />The believing/entrusting into emphatically-me according-as the scripture says, rivers out of{the cavity-ia} of{same} will-flow of{being-alive water}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="39" />Moreover, the-same says about of{the Spirit, which} the believing/entrusting into same have-been-being-about to-be-taking, for not-yet [the] Holy Spirit has-been-being, that the Jesus not-moreover-yet-ly is-esteem-ized/glorified.
<verse style="v" number="40" />So, many out of{the crowd}, hear[ing] the word, have-been-saying, &quot;The-same truly is-being the prophet.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="41" />Others have-been-saying, &quot;The-same is-being the Anointed.&quot; Moreover, others have-been-saying, &quot;For not out of{the Galilee} the Anointed is-being-come,
<verse style="v" number="42" />emphatically-not. The scripture says that out of{the sow-effect} [of-]David, and from Bethlehem, of{the village} which-where David has-been-being, the Anointed is-being-come.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="43" />So, [a] split-effect in to{the crowd} is-become through same.
<verse style="v" number="44" />Moreover, some out of{same} have-been-will-ing to-grab-hold-of same; contrariwise, not-one upon-casts the hands upon same.
<verse style="v" number="45" />So, the subordinates come toward the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and Pharisees, and they-say to{same}, the-there-s, &quot;Through what[?] you-do_not_lead same[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="46" />The subordinates respond, &quot;Not-yet-ever the-same-ly [a] man speaks as the-same, the man.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="47" />So, the Pharisees respond to{same}, &quot;No, also you have-been-led-astray[?]
<verse style="v" number="48" />Not any out of{the chiefs} believes/entrusts into same, or out of{the Pharisees}.
<verse style="v" number="49" />Contrariwise, the crowd, the-same, the not knowing the law are-being cursed-upon[adjective].&quot;
<verse style="v" number="50" />Nicodemus is-saying toward same, the come[ing] of{night} toward same, one being out of{same},
<verse style="v" number="51" />&quot;Not the law of{us} is-judging the man if-supposing it-may_not_hear first beside of{same} and may-know what he-is-doing[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="52" />They-respond and say to{same}, &quot;Not also you are-being out of{the Galilee}[?] Investigate and behold that [a] prophet is_not_being-roused out of{the Galilee},&quot;
<verse style="v" number="53" />and each is-gone into the house of{same};</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="8" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />moreover, Jesus is-gone into the mountain of{the olives}.
<verse style="v" number="2" />Moreover, of{daybreak} again he-becomes-aside into the consecrated[i.e. temple], and all the people has-been-being-come toward same and, sit[ing]-down, he-has-been-teaching same.
<verse style="v" number="3" />Moreover, the scribes and the Pharisees are-leading[i.e. bringing] toward same [a] woman having-been-taken-down/against/according-to in to{adultery} and, stand[ing] same in to{midst},
<verse style="v" number="4" />they-are-saying to{same}, &quot;Teacher, same, the woman, is-taken-down/against/according-to upon to{same-detect-ly[adjective]} [i.e. caught red-handed, in the act] adultering.
<verse style="v" number="5" />Moreover, in to{the law}, Moses commands to{us} the to-whom-the-same to-be-being-stone-cast. So, you, what[?] you-are-saying about of{same}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="6" />Moreover, they-have-been-saying the-same, trial-izing same, in-which-place they-may-be-having to-be-accusing down/against of{same}. Moreover, the Jesus, stoop[ing] down, has-been-writing to{the finger} into the ground, not being-toward-made/done [i.e. acting as if not so].
<verse style="v" number="7" />Moreover, as they-have-been-remaining-upon asking same, stoop[ing]-up/anew, he-says toward same, &quot;The without-sin of{you} first: cast the stone upon same[feminine],
<verse style="v" number="8" />and, again stoop[ing] down, he-has-been-writing into the ground.
<verse style="v" number="9" />Moreover, the hear[ing] under of{the behold-together-sis[i.e. state of beholding together]/conscience}, being-confuted, have-been-being-come-out one according-to one, initiate[ing] from of{the elders} until of{the lasts}, and only the Jesus is-left-behind, and the woman being in to{midst}.
<verse style="v" number="10" />Moreover, stoop[ing]-up/anew, the Jesus, and spectate[ing] no-one more-ly of{the woman}, says to{same}, &quot;Woman, where[?] are-being the-there-s, the accusers of{you}[?] Not-one judges-against you[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="11" />Moreover, the says, &quot;Not-one, Lord.&quot; Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, &quot;Neither I am-judging-against you. Be-being-gone and from of{the} now no-still be-sinning.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="12" />So, again, the Jesus speaks to{same}, saying, I am-being the light of{the world}. The accompanying to{emphatically-me} no, will_not_walk-around in to{the darkness-ia}; contrariwise, he-will-have the light of{the being-alive[noun]}.
<verse style="v" number="13" />So, the Pharisees say to{same}, &quot;You are-witnessing about of{yourself}. The witness-ia of{you} is_not_being true.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="14" />Jesus responds and says to{same}, &quot;And-supposing I may-be-witnessing about of{myself}, the witness-ia of{me} is-being true, that I-have-beheld whence I-come and where I-am-withdrawing; moreover, you have_not_beheld whence I-am-being-come or where I-am-withdrawing.
<verse style="v" number="15" />You are-judging according-to the flesh; I am_not_judging, not-one,
<verse style="v" number="16" />and if-supposing, moreover, I may-be-judging, the judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment], the mine, is-being true, that I-am_not_being alone; contrariwise, I and the Father dispatch[ing] me,
<verse style="v" number="17" />and in to{the law}, moreover, to{the yours}, it-has-been-written that the witness-ia of{two men} is-being true.
<verse style="v" number="18" />I am-being the witnessing about of{myself} and the Father dispatch[ing] me is-witnessing about of{emphatically-me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="19" />So, they-have-been-saying to{same}, &quot;Where[?] is-being the father of{you}[?]&quot; Jesus responds, &quot;Neither you-have-beheld emphatically-me nor the Father of{me}. If supposing you-had-beheld emphatically-me, also you-had-beheld the Father of{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="20" />He-speaks the-same, the say-effects/statements, in to{the treasury}, teaching in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, and not-one grabs-hold-of same, that the hour of{same} not-yet had-come.
<verse style="v" number="21" />So, the Jesus says again to{same}, &quot;I am-withdrawing, and you-will-seek me, and you-will-die-selves-off/away in to{the sin} of{you}; which-where I am-withdrawing you are_not_being-enabled to-come.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />So, the Judeans have-been-saying, &quot;Not-what[?] he-will-kill-off/away sameself, that he-is-saying, &apos;Which-where I am-withdrawing you are_not_being-enabled to-come.&apos;[?],&quot;
<verse style="v" number="23" />and he-says to{same}, &quot;You are-being out of{the down}; I am-being out of{the up}. You are-being out of{the world, the-same}; I am_not_being out of{the world, the-same}.
<verse style="v" number="24" />So, I-say to{you} that you-will-die-selves-off/away in to{the sins} of{you}, for if-supposing you-would_not_believe that I am-being, you-will-die-selves-off/away in to{the sins} of{you}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="25" />So, they-have-been-saying to{same}, &quot;You, who[?] you-are-being[?]&quot; The Jesus says to{same}, &quot;The what also I-am-speaking to{you}, the origin.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="26" />I-am-having many to-be-speaking about of{you}, and to-be-judging; contrariwise, the dispatch[ing] me is-being true, and-I, which I-hear beside of{same}, am-speaking the-same into the world.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="27" />They-do_not_know that he-has-been-saying &quot;the Father&quot; to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="28" />So, the Jesus says to{same}, &quot;When-supposing you-may-elevate the son of{the man}, then you-will-know that I am-being, and from of{myself} I-am-doing nothing; contrariwise, according-as the Father teaches me, I-am-speaking the-same,
<verse style="v" number="29" />and the dispatch[ing] me is-being alongside of{emphatically-me}. He-does_not_let-off/away me alone, that always I am-doing the pleasing[adjective] to{same}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="30" />Of{same speaking} the-same, many believe/entrust into same.
<verse style="v" number="31" />So, the Jesus has-been-saying toward the Judeans having-believed/entrusted to{same}, &quot;If-supposing you may-remain in to{the word, the mine}, you-are-being truly disciples of{me},
<verse style="v" number="32" />and you-will-know the truth and the truth will-emancipate/liberate/release/free you.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="33" />They-respond toward same, &quot;We-are-being [the] sow-effect [of-]Abraham and to{not-one} we-have-been-enslaved ever-yet. How[?] you are-saying that &apos;you-will-become emancipated/liberated/released/free[adjective][?]&apos;&quot;
<verse style="v" number="34" />The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that every, the doing the sin, is-being [a] slave of{the sin}.
<verse style="v" number="35" />Moreover, the slave is_not_remaining in to{the home} into the eon; the Son is-remaining into the eon.
<verse style="v" number="36" />So, if-supposing the Son may-emancipate/liberate/release/free you, being-ly/actually you-will-be emancipated/liberated/released/free[adjective].
<verse style="v" number="37" />I-have-beheld that you-are-being [the] sow-effect [of-]Abraham; contrariwise, you-are-seeking me to-kill-off/away, that the word, the mine, is_not_making-space in to{you}.
<verse style="v" number="38" />What I have-seen beside to{the Father} of{me} I-am-speaking and, so, what you have-seen beside to{the Father} of{you} you-are-doing.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="39" />They-respond and say to{same}, &quot;The father of{us} is-being Abraham.&quot; The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;If supposing offsprings of{the} Abraham you-have-been-being, you-have-been-doing the works of{the} Abraham.
<verse style="v" number="40" />Moreover, now you-are-seeking me to-kill-off/away, [a] man who has-spoken the truth to{you}, which I-hear beside of{the God}. Abraham does_not_do the-same.
<verse style="v" number="41" />You are-doing the works of{the father} of{you}.&quot; So, they-say to{same}, &quot;We have_not_been-begotten out of{sexual-immorality}. We-are-having one Father, the God.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="42" />So, the Jesus says to{same}, &quot;If supposing the God has-been-being Father of{you}, you-have-been-loving emphatically-me, for I come-out out of{the God} and am-arriving, for neither from of{myself} I-have-come; contrariwise, the-there sends-off/away me.
<verse style="v" number="43" />Through what[?] you-are_not_knowing the speech, the mine, that you-are_not_being-enabled to-be-hearing the word, the mine[?]
<verse style="v" number="44" />You are-being out of{the father, the devil/slanderous} and you-are-will-ing to-be-doing the desire-upon-ias of{the father} of{you}. The-there has-been-being homicidal from of{origin} and in to{the truth} has_not_been-standing, that truth is_not_being in to{same}. When-supposing he-may-be-speaking the falsehood, he-is-speaking out of{the[plural] own}, that he-is-being [a] falsifier/liar, and the father of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="45" />Moreover, I, that I-am-saying the truth, you-are_not_believing/entrusting to{me}.
<verse style="v" number="46" />Who[?] out of{you} is-confuting me about of{sin}[?] If I-am-saying truth, through what[?] you are_not_believing/entrusting to{me}[?]
<verse style="v" number="47" />The being out of{the God} is-hearing the say-effects/statements of{the God}. Through the-same, you are_not_hearing, that you-are_not_being out of{the God}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="48" />So, the Judeans respond and say to{same}, &quot;Not well we are-saying that you are-being [a] Samaritan and are-having demon[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="49" />Jesus responds, &quot;I am_not_having demon; contrariwise, I-am-valuing the Father of{me} and you are-un-value-izing me.
<verse style="v" number="50" />Moreover, I am_not_seeking the esteem/glory of{me}. He-is-being the seeking and judging.
<verse style="v" number="51" />Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, if-supposing anyone may-keep the word, the mine, no, he-should_not_observe death into the eon.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="52" />So, the Judeans say to{same}, &quot;Now we-have-known that you-are-having demon. Abraham dies-off/away, and the prophets, and you are-saying, &apos;If-supposing anyone may-keep the word of{me}, no, he-will_not_taste of{death} into the eon.&apos;
<verse style="v" number="53" />You are-being not greater of{the father} of{us}, Abraham, the-who dies-off/away, and the prophets die-off/away. Whom[?] yourself you-are-making[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="54" />Jesus responds, &quot;If-supposing I am-esteem-izing/glorifying myself, the esteem/glory of{me} is-being nothing. The Father of{me} is-being the esteem-izing/glorifying me, whom you are-saying that he-is-being God of{us},
<verse style="v" number="55" />and you-have_not_known same; moreover, I have-beheld same, and if-supposing I-may-say that I-have_not_beheld same, I-will-be [a] falsifier/liar similar of{you}; contrariwise, I-have-beheld same and I-am-keeping the word of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="56" />Abraham, the father of{you}, exults-self in-which-place he-may-behold the day, the mine, and he-beholds and is-joyed.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="57" />So, the Judeans say toward same, &quot;Not-yet you-are-having fifty years and you-have-seen Abraham[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="58" />The Jesus says to{same}, &quot;Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, prior Abraham to-become, I am-being.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="59" />So, they-lift stones in-which-place they-may-cast upon same; moreover, Jesus is-hidden, and comes-out out of{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, come[ing]-through through of{midst} of{same}, and has-been-leading-aside the-same-ly,</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="9" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />and, leading-aside, he-beholds [a] man blind out of{birth},
<verse style="v" number="2" />and the disciples of{same} ask same, saying, &quot;Rabbi, who[?] sins, the-same or the parents of{same}, in-which-place blind he-would-be-begotten[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="3" />Jesus responds, &quot;Neither the-same sins nor the parents of{same}; contrariwise, in-which-place the works of{the God} may-be-revealed in to{same},
<verse style="v" number="4" />it-is-necessitating emphatically-me to-be-work-izing-self the works of{the dispatch[ing]} me while day is-being. Night is-being-come when not-one is-being-enabled to-be-work-izing-self.
<verse style="v" number="5" />When-supposing I-may-be-being in to{the world}, I-am-being light of{the world}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="6" />Say[ing] the-same, he-spits on-the-ground[adverb] and makes mud/clay out of{the spit-effect} and anoints-upon of{same} the mud/clay upon the eyes of{the blind}
<verse style="v" number="7" />and says to{same}, &quot;Be-withdrawing. Wash into the pool of{the Siloam},&quot; which is-being-meant, &quot;having-been-sent-off/away.&quot; So, he-comes-off/away and washes, and he-comes viewing.
<verse style="v" number="8" />So, the neighbors and the observing same the more-before, that he-has-been-being blind, have-been-saying, &quot;Not the-same is-being the being-seated and giving-cause/requesting-toward[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="9" />Others have-been-saying that &quot;he-is-being the-same;&quot; moreover, others, that &quot;emphatically-not, contrariwise, he-is-being similar to{same}.&quot; Moreover, the-there has-been-saying that &quot;I am-being.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="10" />So, they-have-been-saying to{same}, &quot;How[?] the eyes of{you} are-opened-up[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="11" />The-there responds and says, &quot;[A] man being-said &apos;Jesus&apos; makes mud/clay and anoints-upon the eyes of{me} and says to{me}, &apos;Be-withdrawing into the pool of{the Siloam}&quot; and wash.&apos; So, come[ing]-off/away and wash[ing], I-view-anew.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="12" />So, they-say to{same}, &quot;Where[?] he-is-being[?]&quot; The-there is-saying, &quot;I-have_not_beheld.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="13" />They-are-leading same, the at-what-time blind, toward the Pharisees.
<verse style="v" number="14" />Moreover, it-has-been-being [the] sabbath when the Jesus makes the mud/clay and opens-up the eyes of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="15" />So, again, the Pharisees have-been-asking same also how[?] he-views-anew. Moreover, the says to{same}, &quot;He-upon-places mud/clay upon the eyes of{me} and I-wash and I-am-viewing.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="16" />So, some out of{the Pharisees} have-been-saying, &quot;The-same, the man, is_not_being beside of{God}, that he-is_not_keeping the sabbath.&quot; Others have-been-saying, &quot;How[?] sinful man is-being-enabled to-which-the-same signs to-be-doing[?]&quot; and [a] split-effect has-been-being in to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="17" />They-are-saying to{the blind} again, &quot;You, what[?] you-are-saying about of{same}, that he-opens-up the eyes of{you}[?]&quot; Moreover, the says that he-is-being [a] prophet.
<verse style="v" number="18" />So, the Judeans do_not_believe about of{same}, that he-has-been-being blind and views-anew, until of{when} they-sound the parents of{same, the view[ing]-anew},
<verse style="v" number="19" />and they-ask same, saying, &quot;The-same is-being the son of{you}, whom you are-saying that he-is-begotten blind[?] So, how[?] presently he-is-viewing[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="20" />Moreover, the parents of{same} respond to{same} and say, &quot;We-have-beheld that the-same is-being the son of{us} and that he-is-begotten blind;
<verse style="v" number="21" />moreover, how now he-is-viewing we-have_not_beheld or what opens-up the eyes of{same} we have_not_beheld. Same is-having age/stature; ask same. Same will-speak about of{sameself}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />The parents of{same} say the-same, that they-have-been-fearing the Judeans, for already the Judeans had-together-placed in-which-place if-supposing any may-acknowledge same Anointed he-would-become off/away-from-gathering[translit. &quot;synagogue&quot;]-ible[adjective].
<verse style="v" number="23" />Through the-same the parents of{same} say that &quot;he-is-having age/stature; ask same.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="24" />So, they-sound out of{second [instance]} the man who has-been-being blind and say to{same}, &quot;Give esteem/glory to{the God}. We have-beheld that the man, the-same, is-being sinful.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="25" />So, the-there responds, &quot;If he-is-being sinful I-have_not_beheld. I-have-beheld one, that, being blind, presently I-am-viewing.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="26" />So, they-say to{same} again, &quot;What[?] he-does to{you}[?] How[?] he-opens-up the eyes of{you}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="27" />He-responds to{same}, &quot;I-say to{you} already and you-do_not_hear. What[?] again you-are-will-ing to-be-hearing[?] Not also you are-will-ing to-become disciples of{same}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="28" />Moreover, the[plural] insult same and say, &quot;You are-being [a] disciple of{the-there}; moreover, we are-being disciples of{the Moses}.
<verse style="v" number="29" />We have-beheld that to{Moses} the God has-spoken; moreover, we-have_not_beheld the-same, whence he-is-being.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="30" />The man responds and says to{same}, &quot;For in to{the-same} is-being marvelous, that you have_not_beheld whence he-is-being and he-opens-up the eyes of{me}.
<verse style="v" number="31" />Moreover, we-have-beheld that the God is_not_hearing of{sinful}; contrariwise, if-supposing any may-be-being God-reverent and may-be-doing the will-effect of{same}, he-is-hearing of{the-same}.
<verse style="v" number="32" />Out of{the eon} it-is_not_heard that someone opens-up [the] eyes of{having-been-begotten blind}.
<verse style="v" number="33" />If the-same has_not_been-being beside of{God} he-has_not_been-being-enabled to-be-doing, nothing.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="34" />They-respond and say to{same}, &quot;In to{sins} you, whole, are-begotten and you are-teaching us[?],&quot; and they-cast-out same outside.
<verse style="v" number="35" />The Jesus hears that they-cast-out same outside and, discover[ing] same, he-says to{same}, &quot;You are-believing/entrusting into the Son of{the God}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="36" />The-there responds and says, &quot;And who[?] is-being, Lord, in-which-place I-may-believe/entrust into same[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="37" />Moreover, the Jesus says to{same}, &quot;Also, you-have-seen same, and the speaking alongside of{you} is-being the-there.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="38" />Moreover, the has-been-asserting, &quot;I-am-believing, Lord,&quot; and worships to{same},
<verse style="v" number="39" />and the Jesus says, &quot;Into judge-effect/judgment I come into the world, the-same, in-which-place the not viewing may-be-viewing and the viewing may-become blind,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="40" />and the being out of{the Pharisees} hear the-same alongside of{same} and say to{same}, &quot;No, also we are-being blind[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="41" />The Jesus says to{same}, &quot;If supposing you-have-been-being blind, you-have_not_been-having sin; moreover, now you-are-saying that &apos;We-are-viewing,&apos; so, the sin of{you} is-remaining.&quot;</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="10" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />&quot;Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, the not being-come-into through of{the entrance} into the courtyard of{the sheep}; contrariwise, ascending from-another-place, the-there is-being [a] thief and [a] robber.
<verse style="v" number="2" />Moreover, the being-come-into through of{the entrance} is-being shepherd of{the sheep}.
<verse style="v" number="3" />To{the-same} the doorkeeper is-opening-up and the sheep[plural], it-is-hearing of{the sound} of{same} and he-is-sounding the own sheep according-to name and is-leading-out same.
<verse style="v" number="4" />When-supposing he-may-cast-out the own sheep he-is-being-gone in-front of{same} and the sheep[plural], it-is-accompanying to{same}, that they-have-beheld the sound of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="5" />Moreover, to{belonging-to-another} no, they-would_not_accompany; contrariwise, they-will-flee/be-fled away-from of{same}, that they-have_not_beheld the sound of{the belonging-to-others}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="6" />The Jesus says the-same, the proverb, to{same}; moreover, the-there-s do_not_know what has-been-being which he-has-been-speaking to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="7" />So, again the Jesus says to{same}, &quot;Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that I am-being the entrance of{the sheep}.
<verse style="v" number="8" />All as-many-as come before of{emphatically-me} are-being thieves and robbers; contrariwise, the sheep do_not_hear of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="9" />I am-being the entrance. Through of{emphatically-me} if-supposing who may-come-into will-be-saved, and will-be-come-into and will-be-come-out and will-discover pasturage.
<verse style="v" number="10" />The thief is_not_being-come if not in-which-place he-may-steal and he-may-sacrifice[by consequence, kill] and he-may-destroy-off/away. I come in-which-place they-may-be-having being-alive[noun] and they-may-be-having excess.
<verse style="v" number="11" />I am-being the shepherd, the good. The shepherd, the good, is-placing the life of{same} over/for-the-sake of{the sheep}.
<verse style="v" number="12" />Moreover, the hired[noun], also not being shepherd, of{whom} the sheep are_not_being own, is-observing the wolf being-come, and is-letting-off/away the sheep and is-fleeing, and the wolf is-snatching same and is-scattering the sheep.
<verse style="v" number="13" />Moreover, the hired[noun] is-fleeing, that he-is-being [a] hired[noun], and he-is_not_concerning/caring to{same} about of{the sheep}.
<verse style="v" number="14" />I am-being the shepherd, the good, and I-am-knowing the mine and am-being-known under of{the mine},
<verse style="v" number="15" />according-as the Father is-knowing me and-I am-knowing the Father, and I-am-placing the life of{me} over/for-the-sake of{the sheep},
<verse style="v" number="16" />and I-am-having other sheep which is_not_being out of{the courtyard, the-same}, and-the-there it-is-necessitating me to-lead, and of{the sound} of{me} they-will-hear, and they-will-become one shepherded[flock], one shepherd.
<verse style="v" number="17" />Through the-same the Father is-loving me, that I am-placing the life of{me} in-which-place again I-may-take same.
<verse style="v" number="18" />No-one is-lifting same from of{emphatically-me}; contrariwise, I am-placing same from of{myself}. I-am-having authority to-place same and I-am-having authority again to-take same, the-same, the command, I-take beside of{the Father} of{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="19" />So, [a] split-effect again becomes in to{the Judeans} through the words, the-same.
<verse style="v" number="20" />Moreover, many out of{same[plural]} have-been-saying, &quot;He-is-having demon and is-raging/being-mad. What[?] you-are-hearing of{same}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="21" />Others have-been-saying, &quot;The-same, the say-effects/statements, is_not_being of{being-demonized}. No demon is-being-enabled/empowered to-open-up eyes of{[the] blind}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />Moreover, the dedications/consecrations in to{Jerusalems} is-become. It-has-been-being bad-weather/storm/winter,
<verse style="v" number="23" />and the Jesus has-been-walking-around in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]} in to{the portico/colonnade} of{Solomon}.
<verse style="v" number="24" />So, the Judeans circle same and have-been-saying to{same}, &quot;Until at-what-time[?] you-are-lifting the life of{us} [i.e. keeping their lives in suspense][?] If you are-being the Anointed, say to{us} to{all-say-ia}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="25" />The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;I-say to{you} and you-are_not_believing. The works which I am-doing in to{the name} of{the Father} of{me}, the-same, is-witnessing about of{emphatically-me}.
<verse style="v" number="26" />Contrariwise, you are_not_believing, that you-are_not_being out of{the sheep, the mine}, according-as I-say to{you}.
<verse style="v" number="27" />The sheep[plural], the mine, it-is-hearing of{the sound} of{me}, and-I am-knowing same and they-are-accompanying to{me},
<verse style="v" number="28" />and-I am-giving to{same} eternal being-alive[noun], and no, they-would_not_perish-off/away into the eon, and any will_not_snatch same out of{the hand} of{me}.
<verse style="v" number="29" />The Father of{me} who has-given to{me} is-being greater-than of{all} and not-one is-being-enabled to-be-snatching out of{the hand} of{the Father} of{me}.
<verse style="v" number="30" />I and the Father are-being one.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="31" />So, again the Judeans bear[weight] stones in-which-place they-may-stone-ize same.
<verse style="v" number="32" />The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;I-show many good works to{you} out of{the Father} of{me}. Through about-what-such[?] work of{same[neuter plural]} you-are-stone-izing me[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="33" />The Judeans respond to{same}, &quot;About of{good work} we-are_not_stone-izing you; contrariwise, about of{evil-assertion-ia}, and that you, being [a] man, are-making yourself God.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="34" />The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;Not[?] it-is-being having-been-written in to{the law} of{you} that &apos;I say you-are-being gods&apos;[?]
<verse style="v" number="35" />If he-says the-there-s &apos;gods,&apos; toward whom the word of{the God} is-become, and the scripture is_not_being-enabled to-be-loosed,
<verse style="v" number="36" />whom[singular] the Father holy-izes and sends-off/away into the world, you are-saying that &apos;you-are-asserting-evil&apos; that I-say I-am-being Son of{the God}.
<verse style="v" number="37" />If I-am_not_doing the works of{the Father} of{me} do_not_be-believing/entrusting to{me};
<verse style="v" number="38" />moreover, if I-am-doing, also-supposing to{emphatically-me} you-may_not_be-believing, believe to{the works}, in-which-place you-may-know and may-believe that in to{emphatically-me} the Father, and-I in to{same}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="39" />So, they-have-been-seeking again to-grab-hold-of same, and he-comes-out out of{the hand} of{same},
<verse style="v" number="40" />and he-comes-off/away again other-side of{the Jordan} into the place which-where John has-been-being the first immersing and stays there,
<verse style="v" number="41" />and many come toward same and have-been-saying that John on-one-hand does not-one sign; on-the-other-hand, all, as-much-as John says about of{the-same}, has-been-being true,
<verse style="v" number="42" />and many believe/entrust into same there.</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="11" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />Moreover, someone has-been-being being-infirm, Lazarus, from of{Bethany}, out of{the village} of{Mary} and of{Martha, the sister} of{same[feminine]}.
<verse style="v" number="2" />Moreover, Mary has-been-being the oil[ing] the Lord to{ointment} and out-wipe[ing] the feet of{same} to{the hairs} of{same[feminine], whom} the brother, Lazarus, has-been-being-infirm.
<verse style="v" number="3" />So, the sisters send-off/away toward same, saying, &quot;Lord, behold, whom you-are-being-fond-of is-being-infirm.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="4" />Moreover, hear[ing], the Jesus says, &quot;Same, the infirmity, is_not_being toward death; contrariwise, over/for-the-sake of{the esteem/glory} of{the God}, in-which-place the Son of{the God} may-be-esteem-ized/glorified through of{same}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="5" />Moreover, the Jesus has-been-loving the Martha, and the sister of{same}, and the Lazarus.
<verse style="v" number="6" />So, as he-hears that he-is-being-infirm, then, on-one-hand, he-stays to{place}, in to{which} he-has-been-being, two days.
<verse style="v" number="7" />[On the other hand,] upon-thereafter, alongside the-same[neuter singular], he-is-saying to{the disciples}, &quot;We-should-be-leading into the Judea again.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="8" />The disciples are-saying to{same}, &quot;Rabbi, now the Judeans have-been-seeking you to-stone-ize, and again you-are-withdrawing there[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="9" />Jesus responds, &quot;Emphatically-not[?] twelve hours are-being of{the day}[?] If-supposing any may-be-walking-around in to{the day}, he-is_not_striking-toward[i.e. tripping], that he-is-viewing the light of{the world, the-same}.
<verse style="v" number="10" />Moreover, if-supposing any may-be-walking-around in to{the night}, he-is-striking-toward[i.e. tripping], that the light is_not_being in to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="11" />He-says the-same[plural], and alongside the-same[singular], he-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Lazarus, the friend of{us}, has-slept; contrariwise, I-am-being-gone in-which-place I-may-out-sleep-ize/awaken same.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="12" />So, the disciples of{same} say, &quot;Lord, if he-has-slept he-will-be-saved.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="13" />Moreover, the Jesus had-said about of{the death} of{same}; moreover, the-there-s esteem that he-is-saying about of{the sleep-sis[i.e. state of sleeping]} of{the sleep}.
<verse style="v" number="14" />So, then the Jesus says to{same} to{all-say-ia}, &quot;Lazarus dies-off/away,
<verse style="v" number="15" />and I-am-joying through you, in-which-place you-may-believe that I-have_not_been-being there; contrariwise, we-should-be-leading toward same.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="16" />So, Thomas, the being-said &quot;Didymus,&quot; says to{the together-disciples}, &quot;We also should-be-leading in-which-place we-may-die-off/away alongside of{same}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="17" />So, the Jesus, come[ing], discovers same, already four days having in to{the memorial}.
<verse style="v" number="18" />Moreover, the Bethany has-been-being near of{the Jerusalems}, as from of{fifteen stadia}.
<verse style="v" number="19" />Moreover, many out of{the Judeans} had-come toward the[plural] about Martha and Mary, in-which-place they-may-relate-beside same about of{the brother} of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="20" />So, the Martha, as she-hears that Jesus is-being-come, encounters to{same}; moreover, Mary has-been-being-seat-ized in to{the house}.
<verse style="v" number="21" />So, the Martha says toward the Jesus, &quot;Lord, if you-have-been-being here, the brother of{me} not supposing dies-off/away.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />Contrariwise, also now I-have-beheld that as-much-as supposing you-may-give-cause/request the God, the God will-give to{you}.
<verse style="v" number="23" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;The brother of{you} will-stand-up/anew.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="24" />Martha is-saying to{same}, &quot;I-have-beheld that he-will-stand-up/anew in to{the stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection]} in to{the last day}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="25" />The Jesus says to{same}, I am-being the stand-up/anew-sis[i.e. state of resurrection] and the being-alive[noun]. The believing/entrusting into emphatically-me, and-supposing he-may-die-off/away, he-will-be-alive,
<verse style="v" number="26" />and every, the being-alive and believing/entrusting into emphatically-me, no, he-would_not_die-off/away into the eon. You-are-believing the-same[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="27" />She-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Yes, Lord, I have-believed that you are-being the Anointed, the Son of{the God}, the being-come into the world,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="28" />and, say[ing] the-same, she-comes-off/away, and she-sounds Mary, the sister of{same} privately, say[ing], &quot;The teacher is-being-present and is-sounding you.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="29" />Moreover, as the-there hears, she-is-being-roused speedily and is-being-come toward same.
<verse style="v" number="30" />Moreover, not-yet the Jesus had-come into the village; contrariwise, he-has-been-being in to{the place} which-where the Martha encounters to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="31" />So, the Judeans, the being alongside of{same} in to{the home} and relating-beside same, behold[ing] the Mary, that speedily she-stands-up/anew and comes-out, accompany same, saying that she-is-withdrawing into the memorial, in-which-place she-may-weep there.
<verse style="v" number="32" />So, the Mary, as she-comes which-where the Jesus has-been-being, behold[ing] same, falls toward the feet of{same}, saying to{same}, &quot;Lord, if you-have-been-being here, the brother of{me} not supposing dies-off/away.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="33" />So, as Jesus beholds same weeping and the be[ing]-come-together to{same} Judeans weeping, he-expresses-emotion to{the Spirit} and disturbs sameself,
<verse style="v" number="34" />and he-says, &quot;Where[?] you-have-placed same[?]&quot; They-are-saying to{same}, &quot;Lord, be-being-come and behold.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="35" />The Jesus tears.
<verse style="v" number="36" />So, the Judeans have-been-saying, &quot;Behold how he-has-been-being-fond-of same.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="37" />Moreover, some out of{same} say, &quot;He-has_not_been-being-enabled, the-same, the open[ing]-up the eyes of{the blind}, to-do in-which-place also the-same would_not_die-off/away.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="38" />So, Jesus, again expressing-emotion in to{sameself}, is-being-come into the memorial. Moreover, it-has-been-being [a] cave, and [a] stone has-been-being-lain-upon upon to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="39" />The Jesus is-saying, &quot;Lift the stone.&quot; Martha, the sister of{the having-deceased}, is-saying to{same}, &quot;Lord, already it-is-smelling, for it-is-being [the] fourth-day.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="40" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Not[?] I-say to{you} that if-supposing you-would-believe, you-will-see the esteem/glory of{the God}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="41" />So, they-lift the stone, of{which} has-been-being the having-died being-lain. Moreover, the Jesus lifts the eyes up and says, &quot;Father, I-am-well-favoring/giving-thanks to{you} that you-hear of{me}.
<verse style="v" number="42" />Moreover, I had-beheld that always of{me} you-are-hearing; contrariwise, through the crowd, the having-stood-around, I-say, in-which-place they-may-believe that you send-off/away me,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="43" />and, say[ing] the-same, he-cry-out-izes to{large sound}, &quot;Lazarus, Come! out,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="44" />and the having-died comes-out, having-been-bound, the feet and the hands had-been-bound-around to{girths/bandages} and the sight-sis[i.e. state of seeing/sight] of{same} to{sudarium[Latin]/towel/napkin/cloth}. The Jesus is-saying to{same} &quot;Loose same and let-off/away to-be-withdrawing.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="45" />So, many out of{the Judeans}, the come[ing] toward the Mary and spectate[ing] what the Jesus does, believe/entrust into same.
<verse style="v" number="46" />Moreover, some out of{same} come-off/away toward the Pharisees and say to{same} what the Jesus does.
<verse style="v" number="47" />So, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the Pharisees gather council and have-been-saying, &quot;What[?] we-are-doing, that the-same, the man, is-doing many signs[?]
<verse style="v" number="48" />If-supposing we-should-let-off/away same, the-same-ly all will-believe/entrust into same and the Romans will-be-come and will-lift of{us} and/also the place and the nation.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="49" />Moreover, one who, out of{same}, Caiaphas, chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest], being of{the same-year, the-there}, says to{same}, &quot;You have_not_beheld, nothing/not-one.
<verse style="v" number="50" />Nor you-are-word-izing/reckoning/accounting-selves that it-is-carrying/bearing-together to{us} in-which-place one man would-die-off/away over/for-the-sake of{the people} and not the whole nation would-perish-off/away.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="51" />Moreover, he-does_not_say the-same from of{sameself}; contrariwise, being chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] of{the same-year, the-there} he-prophesies that the Jesus has-been-being-about to-be-dying-off/away over/for-the-sake of{the nation},
<verse style="v" number="52" />and not over/for-the-sake of{the nation} only; contrariwise, in-which-place also the offsprings of{the God}, the having-been-scattered-through, would-gather into one.
<verse style="v" number="53" />So, from of{the-there, the day,} they-together-intend in-which-place they-may-be-killing-off/away same.
<verse style="v" number="54" />So, Jesus has_not-still_been-walking-around to{all-say-ia} in to{the Judeans}; contrariwise, he-comes-off/away from-there into the region near of{the desolate} into Ephraim, being-said city, and-there has-been-engaging alongside of{the disciples} of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="55" />Moreover, the passover of{the Judeans} has-been-being near, and many ascend into Jerusalem out of{the region} before of{the} passover in-which-place they-may-purify sameselves.
<verse style="v" number="56" />So, they-have-been-seeking the Jesus and have-been-saying, having-stood alongside of{one-another} in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, &quot;What[?] is-esteeming to{you}, that, no, he-would_not_come into the festival[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="57" />Moreover, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the Pharisees had-given [a] command in-which-place if-supposing any would-know where he-is-being, he-should-disclose which-how they-may-grab-hold-of same.</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="12" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />So, the Jesus, before six of{days} of{the} passover, comes into Bethany, which-where has-been-being Lazarus, the having-died whom he-rouses out of{dead}.
<verse style="v" number="2" />So, they-make to{same} [a] dinner/supper there and the Martha has-been-serving. Moreover, the Lazarus has-been-being one of{the being-lain-up/anew} together-with to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="3" />So, the Mary, take[ing] [a] litra[Latin &quot;libra&quot;] of{ointment} of{much-valuable, faithful/trustworthy spikenard}, oils the feet of{the Jesus} and wipes to{the hairs} of{same} the feet of{same}. Moreover, the home is-filled-full out of{the smell} of{the ointment}.
<verse style="v" number="4" />So, one out of{the disciples} of{same}, Judas of{Simon} Iscariot, the being-about to-be-giving-aside/delivering same, is-saying,
<verse style="v" number="5" />&quot;Through what[?], the-same, the ointment, is_not_liquidated-for-sale of{three-hundred denarii} and is-given to{destitute}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="6" />Moreover, he-says the-same not that about of{the destitute} he-has-been-concerning/caring to{same}; contrariwise, that he-has-been-being [a] thief, and has-been-having the tongue-case[i.e. small box], and has-been-bearing[weight] the being-cast [into it].
<verse style="v" number="7" />So, the Jesus says, &quot;Let-off/away-from same[feminine], in-which-place she-may-keep same into the day of{the en-burial-ization} of{me},
<verse style="v" number="8" />for always you-are-having the destitute alongside of{sameselves}; moreover, you-are_not_having emphatically-me always.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="9" />So, [a] vast crowd out of{the Judeans} knows that he-is-being there and they-come not through the Jesus only; contrariwise, in-which-place also they-may-behold the Lazarus, whom he-rouses out of{dead}.
<verse style="v" number="10" />Moreover, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] intend in-which-place also they-may-be-killing-off/away the Lazarus,
<verse style="v" number="11" />that through same many of{the Judeans} have-been-withdrawing and have-been-believing/entrusting into the Jesus.
<verse style="v" number="12" />To{the} upon-the-next-day [a] vast crowd, the come[ing] into the festival, hear[ing] that Jesus is-being-come into Jerusalem,
<verse style="v" number="13" />take the palm-leaf-branches of{the palm-trees} and come-out into encounter to{same}, and have-been-crying-out, &quot;Hosanna, having-been-good-word-ed, the being-come in to{[the] name} of{[the] Lord}, king of{the} Israel.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="14" />Moreover, the Jesus, discover[ing] [a] donkey-ling[diminutive], sits-down upon same according-as it-is-being having-been-written,
<verse style="v" number="15" />&quot;Do_not_be-fearing, daughter [of-]Zion. Behold, the king of{you} is-being-come, being-seated upon [a] colt of{[a] donkey}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="16" />Moreover, the disciples of{same} do_not_know the-same, the first; contrariwise, when the Jesus is-esteem-ized/glorified, then they-remember that the-same has-been-being upon to{same} having-been-written, and [that] they-do the-same to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="17" />So, the crowd, the being alongside of{same} when he-sounds the Lazarus out of{the memorial} and rouses same out of{dead}, has-been-witnessing.
<verse style="v" number="18" />Through the-same[neuter] also the crowd encounters to{same[masculine]}, that it-hears the-same[neuter], same[masculine] to-have-done the sign.
<verse style="v" number="19" />So, the Pharisees say toward sameselves, &quot;You-are-observing that you-are_not_profiting, not-one. Behold, the world comes-off/away behind of{same}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="20" />Moreover, some Greeks have-been-being out of{the ascending}, in-which-place they-may-worship in to{the festival}.
<verse style="v" number="21" />So, the-same come-toward to{Philip, the} from Bethsaida of{the Galilee}, and have-been-asking same, saying, &quot;Lord, we-are-will-ing to-behold the Jesus.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />Philip is-being-come and is-saying to{the Andrew}, and again Andrew and Philip are-saying to{the Jesus}.
<verse style="v" number="23" />Moreover, the Jesus responds to{same}, saying, &quot;The hour has-come in-which-place the son of{the man} may-be-esteem-ized/glorified.
<verse style="v" number="24" />Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, if-supposing not the kernel of{the grain} fall[ing] into the ground may-die-off/away, same alone is-remaining; moreover, if-supposing it-may-die-off/away, it-is-carrying much fruit.
<verse style="v" number="25" />The being-fond-of the life of{same} will-destroy-off/away same, and the hating the life of{same} in to{the world, the-same}, will-guard same into eternal being-alive[noun].
<verse style="v" number="26" />If-supposing to{emphatically-me} any may-be-serving: be-accompanying to{emphatically-me}, and which-where I am-being, there also the servant, the mine, will-be, and if-supposing any may-be-serving to{emphatically-me} the Father will-value same.
<verse style="v" number="27" />Now the life of{me} has-been-disturbed, and what[?] I-may-say, &apos;Father, save me out of{the hour, the-same}[?]&apos; Contrariwise, through the-same I-come into the hour, the-same.
<verse style="v" number="28" />Father, esteem-ize/glorify the name of{you}.&quot; So, [a] sound comes out of{the heaven} also, &quot;I-esteem-ize/glorify and again I-will-esteem-ize/glorify.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="29" />So, the crowd, the having-stood and hear[ing], has-been-saying to-have-become thunder; others have-been-saying [a] messenger has-spoken to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="30" />Jesus responds and says, &quot;Not through[i.e. on account of] emphatically-me same, the sound, has-become; contrariwise, through[i.e. on account of] you.
<verse style="v" number="31" />Now is-being judge-sis[i.e. state of judgment] of{the world, the-same}. Now the chief of{the world, the-same} will-be-cast-out outside,
<verse style="v" number="32" />and-I, if-supposing I-may-be-elevated out of{the earth}, I-will-pull all[masculine plural] toward myself.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="33" />Moreover, he-has-been-saying the-same, signifying to{about-what-such death} he-has-been-being-about to-be-dying-off/away.
<verse style="v" number="34" />The crowd responds to{same}, &quot;We hear out of{the law} that the Anointed is-remaining into the eon, and how[?] you are-saying that it-is-necessitating to-be-elevated, the son of{the man}. Who[?] is-being the-same, the son of{the man}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="35" />So, the Jesus says to{same}, &quot;Still little time is-being the light alongside of{you}. Be-walking-around while you-are-having the light, in-which-place no darkness-ia may-take-down/against/according-to you and the walking-around in to{the darkness-ia} has_not_beheld where it-is-withdrawing.
<verse style="v" number="36" />While you-are-having the light, be-believing/entrusting into the light, in-which-place you-may-become sons of{light}. The Jesus speaks the-same and, come[ing]-off/away, is-hidden from of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="37" />Moreover, of{same having-done} the-which-the-same signs in-front of{same}, they-have_not_been-believing/entrusting into same,
<verse style="v" number="38" />in-which-place the word of{Isaiah, the prophet} would-be-fulfilled, whom he-says, &quot;Lord, who[?] believes/entrusts to{the heard[noun]} of{us} and the arm of{[the] Lord} to{whom[?]} it-is-off-covered/uncovered[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="39" />Through the-same they-have_not_been-being-enabled to-be-believing/entrusting, that again Isaiah says,
<verse style="v" number="40" />&quot;He-has-blinded the eyes of{same} and has-calloused the heart of{same}, in-which-place lest they-would-behold to{the eyes} and would-think to{the heart} and would-be-upon-turned and I-would-cure same.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="41" />Isaiah says the-same when he-beholds the esteem/glory of{same}, and he-speaks about of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="42" />Likewise, nevertheless, also out of{the chiefs} many believe/entrust into same; contrariwise, through[i.e. on account of] the Pharisees, they-have_not_been-same-word-ing/acknowledging, lest in-which-place they-would-become off/away-from-gathering[translit. &quot;synagogue&quot;]-ible[adjective],
<verse style="v" number="43" />for they-love the esteem/glory of{the men} more than-about the esteem/glory of{the God}.
<verse style="v" number="44" />Moreover, Jesus cries-out and says, &quot;The believing/entrusting into emphatically-me is_not_believing/entrusting into emphatically-me; contrariwise, into the dispatch[ing] me,
<verse style="v" number="45" />and the observing emphatically-me is-observing the dispatch[ing] me.
<verse style="v" number="46" />I have-come [a] light into the world, in-which-place every, the believing/entrusting into emphatically-me, would_not_remain in to{the darkness-ia},
<verse style="v" number="47" />and if-supposing any may-hear of{the say-effects/statements} of{me} and may_not_guard, I am_not_judging same, for I-do_not_come in-which-place I-may-be-judging the world; contrariwise, in-which-place I-may-save the world.
<verse style="v" number="48" />The un-placing/rejecting emphatically-me and not taking the say-effects/statements of{me} is-having the judging same. The word whom I-speak, the-there, will-judge same in to{the last day},
<verse style="v" number="49" />that I do_not_speak out of{myself}; contrariwise, the dispatch[ing] me, same Father gives to{me} command, what I-may-say and what I-may-speak,
<verse style="v" number="50" />and I-have-beheld that the command of{same} is-being eternal being-alive[noun], so, what I am-speaking, according-as the Father has-said to{me}, the-same-ly I-am-speaking.&quot;</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="13" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />Moreover, before of{the festival} of{the} passover, the Jesus having-beheld that the hour of{same} comes in-which-place he-may-change-course/step-across/transition out of{the world, the-same} toward the Father, love[ing] the[plural] own, the[plural] in to{the world}, he-loves same[plural] into finish/completion,
<verse style="v" number="2" />and of{dinner/supper become[ing]}, of{the devil/slanderous having-cast} already into the heart of{Judas Simon Iscariot} in-which-place he-may-give-aside/deliver same,
<verse style="v" number="3" />the Jesus having-beheld that the Father has-given all to{same}, into the hands, and that from of{God} he-comes-out and toward the God is-withdrawing,
<verse style="v" number="4" />he-is-being-roused out of{the dinner/supper} and is-placing the outer-garments and, take[ing] [a] towel[Latin &quot;linteum&quot;], through-girds sameself.
<verse style="v" number="5" />Thereafter, he-is-casting water into the wash-basin and initiates to-be-washing the feet of{the disciples} and to-be-wiping-out to{the towel[Latin &quot;linteum&quot;], which} has-been-being having-been-through-girded.
<verse style="v" number="6" />So, he-is-being-come toward Simon Peter, and the-there is-saying to{same}, &quot;Lord, you are-washing the feet of{me}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="7" />Jesus responds and says to{same}, &quot;What I am-doing you have_not_beheld presently; moreover, you-will-know alongside the-same[plural].&quot;
<verse style="v" number="8" />Peter is-saying to{same}, &quot;No, you-should_not_wash the feet of{me} into the eon.&quot; Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;If-supposing I-should_not_wash you, you-are_not_having share/portion/part alongside of{emphatically-me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="9" />Simon Peter is-saying to{same}, &quot;Lord, not the feet of{me} only; contrariwise, also the hands and the head.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="10" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;The having-been-bathed is_not_having need than to-wash/be-washed the feet; contrariwise, he-is-being whole[ly] clean, and you[plural] are-being clean; contrariwise, emphatically-not all,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="11" />for he-had-beheld the giving-aside/delivering same; through the-same he-says, &quot;Emphatically-not all are-being clean.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="12" />So, when he-washes the feet of{same} and takes the outer-garments of{same}, fall[ing]-anew[i.e. sit down] again, he-says to{same}, &quot;You-are-knowing what[?] I-have-done to{you}[?]
<verse style="v" number="13" />You are-sounding me &quot;The teacher&quot; and &quot;the Lord,&quot; and you-are-saying well, for I-am-being.
<verse style="v" number="14" />So, if I wash the feet of{you}, &quot;the Lord&quot; and &quot;the teacher,&quot; also you are-owing of{one-another} to-be-washing the feet,
<verse style="v" number="15" />for I-give to{you} show-effect-under in-which-place according-as I do to{you} also you may-be-doing.
<verse style="v" number="16" />Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, [a] slave is_not_being greater-than of{the lord} of{same}, nor [a] sent-off[one] greater-than of{the dispatch[ing]} same.
<verse style="v" number="17" />If you-have-beheld the-same[plural], you-are-being blessed if-supposing you-may-be-doing same[plural].
<verse style="v" number="18" />Not about of{all} of{you} I-am-saying. I have-beheld whom I-choose; contrariwise, in-which-place the scripture may-be-fulfilled, &quot;The munching the bread alongside of{emphatically-me} lifts-upon upon emphatically-me the heel of{same}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="19" />From presently I-am-saying to{you} before of{the} to-become, in-which-place when-supposing it-may-become, you-may-believe that I am-being.
<verse style="v" number="20" />Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, the taking if-supposing someone I-may-dispatch is-taking emphatically-me; moreover, the taking emphatically-me is-taking the dispatch[ing] me.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="21" />The Jesus, say[ing] the-same, is-disturbed to{the Spirit}, and witnesses and says, &quot;Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you} that one out of{you} will-give-aside/deliver me.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />So, the disciples have-been-viewing into one-another, being-perplexed about of{whom} he-is-saying.
<verse style="v" number="23" />Moreover, one of{the disciples} of{same} has-been-being being-lain-up/anew in to{the bosom/lap} of{the Jesus}, whom the Jesus has-been-loving.
<verse style="v" number="24" />So, Simon Peter is-nodding to{the-same} to-ascertain who[?] supposing might-be-being about of{whom} he-is-saying.
<verse style="v" number="25" />So, the-there, fall[ing]-upon upon the chest/sternum of{the Jesus}, is-saying to{same}, &quot;Lord, who[?] it-is-being[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="26" />The Jesus is-responding, &quot;The-there is-being to{whom} I, dip[ing], the morsel, will-give-upon,&quot; and, dip[ing]-in, the morsel, he-is-giving to{Judas of{Simon} Iscariot},
<verse style="v" number="27" />and alongside the morsel, then the Satan/adversary comes-into into the-there, so, the Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;What you-are-doing do more-speedily.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="28" />Moreover, not-one knows the-same, of{the being-lain-up/anew}, toward what he-says to{same},
<verse style="v" number="29" />for some have-been-esteeming since the Judas has-been-having the tongue-case[i.e. small box], that the Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Purchase of{what} we-are-having need into the festival,&quot; or in-which-place what he-may-give to{the destitute}.
<verse style="v" number="30" />So, take[ing] the morsel, the-there straightaway comes-out. Moreover, it-has-been-being night.
<verse style="v" number="31" />So, when he-comes-out, the Jesus is-saying, &quot;Now the son of{the man} is-esteem-ized/glorified, and the God is-esteem-ized/glorified in to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="32" />If the God is-esteem-ized/glorified in to{same} also the God will-esteem-ize/glorify same in to{sameself} and straightaway will-esteem-ize/glorify same.
<verse style="v" number="33" />Offspring-lings, still little alongside of{you} I-am-being. You-will-seek me and, according-as I-say to{the Judeans}, that which-where I am-withdrawing you are_not_being-enabled to-come, also to{you} I-am-saying presently.
<verse style="v" number="34" />I-am-giving to{you} [a] new command in-which-place you-should-be-loving one-another according-as I-love you, in-which-place also you should-be-loving one-another.
<verse style="v" number="35" />In to{the-same} all will-know that to{emphatically-me} you-are-being disciples, if-supposing you-may-be-having love in to{one-another}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="36" />Simon Peter is-saying to{same}, &quot;Lord, where[?] you-are-withdrawing[?]&quot; The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;Which-where I-am-withdrawing you-are_not_being-enabled now to-accompany to{me}; moreover, afterward you-will-accompany to{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="37" />Peter is-saying to{same}, &quot;Lord, through what[?] I-am_not_being-enabled to-accompany to{you} presently[?] I-will-place the life of{me} over/for-the-sake of{you}.
<verse style="v" number="38" />The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;You-will-place the life of{you} over/for-the-sake of{emphatically-me}. Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, no, [a] rooster will_not_sound until of{which} you-will-deny-off/away me thrice.&quot;</para>

<verse style="v" number="2" />Moreover, also Judas, the giving-aside/delivering same, had-beheld the place, that often the Jesus is-gathered there alongside of{the disciples} of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="3" />So, the Judas, take[ing] the [military]cohort and subordinates out of{the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests]} and of{Pharisees}, is-being-come there alongside of{revealings[noun]/illuminations} and of{torches} and of{implements/arms/weapons}.
<verse style="v" number="4" />So, Jesus, having-beheld all the being-come upon same, come[ing]-out, says to{same}, &quot;Whom[?] you-are-seeking[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="5" />They-respond to{same}, &quot;Jesus, the Nazarene.&quot; The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;I am-being.&quot; Moreover, also Judas, the giving-aside/delivering same, had-stood alongside of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="6" />So, as he-says to{same}, &quot;I am-being,&quot; they-come-off/away into the behind and fall on-the-ground[adverb].
<verse style="v" number="7" />So, again he-asks-upon same, &quot;Whom[?] you-are-seeking[?]&quot; Moreover, the say, &quot;Jesus the Nazarene.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="8" />Jesus responds, &quot;I-say to{you} that I am-being. So, if you-are-seeking emphatically-me, let-off/away the-same[plural] to-be-withdrawing,
<verse style="v" number="9" />in-which-place the word may-be-fulfilled which says that &apos;whom you-have-given to{me} I-do_not_lose-off/away out of{same}, not-one.&apos;&quot;
<verse style="v" number="10" />So, Simon Peter, having [a] knife, pulls same and strikes the slave of{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}, and cuts-off/away the earlet of{same}, the right; moreover [the] name to{the slave} has-been-being &quot;Malchus.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="11" />So, the Jesus says to{the Peter}, &quot;Cast the knife of{you} into the sheath/place. The Father has-given to{me} the cup which, no, I-should_not_drink same[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="12" />So, the [military]cohort and the thousand-chief/chiliarch and the subordinates of{the Judeans} together-take the Jesus, and bind same,
<verse style="v" number="13" />and lead-off/away same toward Annas first, for he-has-been-being father-in-law of{the Caiaphas}, who has-been-being chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] of{the same-year, the-there}.
<verse style="v" number="14" />Moreover, Caiaphas has-been-being the together-intention[ing] to{the Judeans}, that &quot;it-is-carrying/bearing-together one man to-die-off/away over/for-the-sake of{the people}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="15" />Moreover, Simon Peter has-been-accompanying to{the Jesus}, and the another disciple; moreover, the disciple, the-there has-been-being known[adjective] to{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]} and comes-into-together to{the Jesus} into the courtyard of{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}.
<verse style="v" number="16" />Moreover, the Peter had-stood toward to{the entrance/door} outside, so the disciple, the other, who has-been-being known[adjective] to{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}, comes-out and says to{the doorkeeper} and into-leads the Peter.
<verse style="v" number="17" />So, the girlie, the doorkeeper, is-saying to{the Peter}, &quot;Not also you are-being out of{the disciples} of{the man, the-same}[?]&quot; The-there is-saying, &quot;I-am_not_being.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="18" />Moreover, the slaves and the subordinates had-stood, having-made [a] charcoal/coal-ia[fire], that it-has-been-being cold and they-have-been-being-warmed. Moreover, the Peter has-been-being alongside of{same}, having-stood and being-warmed.
<verse style="v" number="19" />So, the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest] asks the Jesus about of{the disciples} of{same} and about of{the teaching} of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="20" />The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;I speak to{all-say-ia} to{the world}. I always teach in to{the gathering[translit. &apos;synagogue&apos;]} and in to{the consecrated[i.e. temple]}, which-where the Judeans always are-being-come-together, and in to{hidden[adjective]} I-speak not-one/nothing.
<verse style="v" number="21" />What[?] you-are-asking-upon me[?] Ask-upon the having-heard what I-speak to{same}. Behold, the-same have-beheld what I say.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />Moreover, of{same say[ing]} the-same, one of{the subordinates} having-stood-aside/beside/near gives slap-ize-effect to{the Jesus}, say[ing], &quot;The-same-ly you-are-responding to{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="23" />The Jesus responds to{same}, &quot;If badly I-speak, witness about of{the bad}; moreover, if well, what[?] you-are-flaying me[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="24" />So, the Annas sends-off/away same, having-been-bound, toward Caiaphas, the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest].
<verse style="v" number="25" />Moreover, Simon Peter has-been-being having-stood and being-warmed. So, they-say to{same}, &quot;Not also you are-being out of{the disciples} of{same}[?]&quot; The-there denies and says, &quot;I-am_not_being.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="26" />One out of{the slaves} of{the chief-consecrated[i.e. chief priest]} being together-begotten[i.e. related] of{whom} Peter cuts-off/away the earlet is-saying, &quot;Not I behold you in to{the plantation} alongside of{same}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="27" />So, again the Peter denies, and straightaway [a] rooster sounds.
<verse style="v" number="28" />So, they-are-leading the Jesus from of{the Caiaphas} into the praetorium[Latin]; moreover, it-has-been-being early/morning and same do_not_come-into into the praetorium[Latin] in-which-place they-would_not_be-tainted/contaminated; contrariwise, in-which-place they-may-eat the passover.
<verse style="v" number="29" />So, the Pilate comes-out outside toward same[plural] and says, &quot;What[?] accusation you-are-carrying against of{the man, the-same}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="30" />They-respond and say to{same}, &quot;If supposing the-same has_not_been-being bad-doing-ful, we-do_not_give-aside/deliver same to{you}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="31" />So, the Pilate says to{same}, &quot;You, take same and judge same according-to the law of{you}.&quot; So, the Judeans say to{same}, &quot;To{us} is_not_being-permitted to-kill-off/away, not-one,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="32" />in-which-place the word of{the Jesus} may-be-fulfilled, which he-says signifying to{about-what-such death} he-has-been-being-about to-be-dying-off/away.
<verse style="v" number="33" />So, the Pilate comes-into into the praetorium[Latin] again, and sounds the Jesus, and says to{same}, &quot;You are-being the king of{the Judeans}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="34" />The Jesus responds, &quot;From of{sameself} you are-saying the-same, or others say to{you} about of{emphatically-me}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="35" />The Pilate responds, &quot;Not-what[?] I am-being Judean[?] The nation, the yours, and the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] give-aside/deliver you to{emphatically-me}. What[?] you-do[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="36" />Jesus responds, &quot;The kingdom, the mine, is_not_being out of{the world, the-same}. If supposing out of{the world, the-same} has-been-being the kingdom, the mine, the subordinates, the to{emphatically-me}, have-been-competing/contending, in-which-place I-would_not_be-given-aside/delivered to{the Judeans}; moreover, now the kingdom, the mine, is_not_being from-here.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="37" />So, the Pilate says to{same}, &quot;So-not[?], you are-being [a] king[?]&quot; Jesus responds, &quot;You are-saying that I am-being [a] king. Into the-same I have-been-begotten, and into the-same I-have-come into the world, in-which-place I-may-witness to{the truth}. Every, the being out of{the truth}, is-hearing of{me, the sound}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="38" />The Pilate is-saying to{same}, &quot;What[?] is-being truth[?],&quot; and, say[ing] the-same, again he-comes-out toward the Judeans and is-saying to{same}, &quot;I am-discovering not-one cause in to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="39" />Moreover, it-is-being together-habituation to{you} in-which-place I-may-loose-off/away one to{you} in to{the passover}. So, you-are-intending I-may-loose-off/away to{you} the king of{the Judeans}[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="40" />So, all cry-out-ize, saying, &quot;Not the-same; contrariwise, the bar-Abbas.&quot; Moreover, the bar-Abbas has-been-being [a] robber.</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="19" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />So, then, the Pilate takes the Jesus and scourges,
<verse style="v" number="2" />and the soldiers, weave[ing] [a] garland/crown out of{thorn-bushes}, place-upon to{the head} of{same}, and drape-around purple outer-garment same,
<verse style="v" number="3" />and they-have-been-saying, &quot;Be-joying, the king of{the Judeans},&quot; and they-have-been-giving slap-ize-effects to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="4" />So, again the Pilate comes-out outside and is-saying to{same[plural]}, &quot;Behold, I-am-leading same outside to{you}, in-which-place you-may-know that in to{same} I-am-discovering not-one cause.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="5" />So, the Jesus comes-out outside, carrying/bearing the thorny garland/crown and the purple outer-garment, and he-is-saying to{same[plural]}, &quot;Behold the man.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="6" />So, when the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] and the subordinates behold same, they-cry-out-ize, saying, &quot;Crucify, crucify same.&quot; The Pilate is-saying to{same}, &quot;You, take same and crucify, for I am_not_discovering cause in to{same}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="7" />The Judeans respond to{same}, &quot;We are-having [a] law, and according-to the law of{us} it-is-owing to-die-off/away, that he-makes sameself Son of{God}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="8" />So, when the Pilate hears the-same, the word, he-fears more,
<verse style="v" number="9" />and he-comes-into into the praetorium[Latin] again and is-saying to{the Jesus}, &quot;Whence you are-being[?]&quot;; moreover, the Jesus does_not_give response to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="10" />So, the Pilate is-saying to{same}, &quot;To{emphatically-me} you-are_not_speaking[?] You-have_not_beheld that I-am-having authority to-crucify you and I-am-having authority to-loose-off/away you[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="11" />The Jesus responds, &quot;You-have_not_been-having authority, not-one, against/according-to of{emphatically-me} if not it-has-been-being having-been-given to{you} up-place-ly. Through the-same, the giving-aside/delivering me to{you} is-having greater sin.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="12" />Out of{the-same} the Pilate has-been-seeking to-loose-off/away same; moreover, the Judeans have-been-cry-out-izing, saying, &quot;If-supposing you-may-loose-off/away the-same, you-are_not_being friend of{the Caesar}. Every, the making sameself king, is-saying-in-place-of/in-opposition-to/contradicting/rebutting to{the Caesar}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="13" />So, the Pilate, hear[ing] of{the words, the-same}, leads the Jesus outside and sits-down upon of{the step-effect} into [the] place being-said, &quot;stone-paved/spread;&quot; moreover, Hebrew-ly &quot;gabbatha.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="14" />Moreover, preparation has-been-being of{the} passover; [the] hour has-been-being as-if sixth, and he-is-saying to{the Judeans}, &quot;Behold, the king of{you}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="15" />Moreover, the[plural] cry-out-ize, &quot;Lift, lift, crucify same.&quot; The Pilate is-saying to{same}, &quot;I-will-crucify the king of{you}.&quot; The chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] respond, &quot;We-are_not_having [a] king if not Caesar.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="16" />So, then he-gives-aside/delivers same to{same[plural]} in-which-place he-may-be-crucified. Moreover they-take-aside the Jesus and lead-off/away,
<verse style="v" number="17" />and, bearing[weight] the cross of{sameself}, he-comes-out into the being-said, &quot;place of{skull},&quot; which Hebrew-ly is-being-said, &quot;Golgotha,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="18" />which-where they-crucify same, and alongside of{same} two others, from-here and from-here; moreover, the Jesus midst.
<verse style="v" number="19" />Moreover, also the Pilate writes [a] title, and places upon of{the cross}; moreover, it-has-been-being having-been-written, &quot;Jesus the Nazarene, the king of{the Judeans}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="20" />So, many know-anew the-same, the title, of{the Judeans}, that the place has-been-being near of{the city}, which-where the Jesus is-crucified, and it-has-been-being having-been-written Hebrew-ly, Greek-ly, Latin-ly.
<verse style="v" number="21" />So, the chief-consecrateds[i.e. chief priests] of{the Judeans} have-been-saying to{the Pilate}, &quot;Do_not_be-writing, &apos;The king of{the Judeans};&apos; contrariwise, that the-there says, &apos;I-am-being king of{the Judeans}.&apos;&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />The Pilate responds, &quot;What I-have-written I-have-written.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="23" />So, when the soldiers crucify the Jesus, they-take the outer-garments of{same} and make four parts, [a] part to{each soldier}, and the inner-garment; moreover, the inner-garment has-been-being seamless out of{the} up-place-ly interwoven[adjective] through of{whole}.
<verse style="v" number="24" />So, they-say toward one-another, &quot;We-should_not_split same; contrariwise, we-should-obtain[i.e. cast lot] about of{same}, of{whom} it-will-be,&quot; in-which-place the scripture may-be-fulfilled, the saying, &quot;They-part/divide-through-selves the outer-garments of{me} to{sameselves} and upon the outer-garment-set of{me} they-cast lot.&quot; So, on-one-hand, the soldiers do the-same;
<verse style="v" number="25" />on-the-other-hand the mother of{same}, and the sister of{the mother} of{same}, Mary, the of{the Clopas}, and Mary, the Magdalene, had-stood beside to{the cross} of{the Jesus}.
<verse style="v" number="26" />So, Jesus, behold[ing] the mother and the disciple having-stood-beside, whom he-has-been-loving, is-saying to{the mother} of{same}, &quot;Woman, behold, the son of{you}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="27" />Thereafter/accordingly, he-is-saying to{the disciple}, &quot;Behold, the mother of{you},&quot; and from of{the-there, the hour} the disciple takes same[feminine] into the own.
<verse style="v" number="28" />Alongside the-same, the Jesus, having-beheld that all already has-been-completed, in-which-place the scripture may-be-accomplished, is-saying, &quot;I-am-thirsting.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="29" />So, [a] vessel has-been-being-lain, replete of{vinegar}; moreover, the[masculine plural], fill[ing] [a] sponge of{vinegar} and place[ing]-around to{hyssop}, carry-toward to{the mouth} of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="30" />So, when the Jesus takes the vinegar, he-says, &quot;It-has-been-completed,&quot; and, lean[ing] the head, he-gives-aside/delivers the spirit/breath.
<verse style="v" number="31" />So, the Judeans, since it-has-been-being preparation, in-which-place the bodies should_not_remain upon of{the cross} in to{the sabbath}, for great has-been-being the day of{the-there, the sabbath}, ask the Pilate in-which-place the legs of{same} may-be-broken-down and they-may-be-lifted.
<verse style="v" number="32" />So, the soldiers come and, on-one-hand, break-down the legs of{the first} and of{the other} of{the crucified-together} to{same}.
<verse style="v" number="33" />On-the-other-hand, come[ing] upon the Jesus, as they-behold same already having-died, they-do_not_break-down the legs of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="34" />Contrariwise, one of{the soldiers} pierces the side to{spear-head/lance} of{same}, and straightaway blood and water comes-out,
<verse style="v" number="35" />and the having-seen has-witnessed and the witness-ia of{same} is-being genuine, and-the-there has-beheld that he-is-saying true, in-which-place also you may-believe,
<verse style="v" number="36" />for the-same is-become in-which-place the scripture may-be-fulfilled, &quot;[A] bone will_not_be-worn-down-together/broken/crushed of{same},&quot;
<verse style="v" number="37" />and again [a] different-other scripture is-saying, &quot;They-will-see into whom they-goad/prick/sting/stab-out.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="38" />Moreover, alongside the-same, Joseph, the from of{Arimathea}, being [a] disciple of{the Jesus}, moreover having-been-hidden through the fear of{the Judeans}, asks the Pilate in-which-place he-may-lift the body of{the Jesus}, and the Pilate upon-turns, so he-comes and lifts the body of{the Jesus}.
<verse style="v" number="39" />Moreover, also Nicodemus comes, the come[ing] toward the Jesus of{night}, the first, carrying [a] mix-effect of{myrrh} and of{aloe} as-if [a] hundred litras[Latin &quot;libra&quot;].
<verse style="v" number="40" />So, they-take the body of{the Jesus} and bind same to{linen-cloths} alongside of{the aromatics} according-as is-being [the] custom to{the Judeans} to-be-en-burial-izing.
<verse style="v" number="41" />Moreover, [a] plantation has-been-being in to{the place} which-where he-is-crucified, and in to{the plantation} [a] new memorial in to{which} not-moreover-yet-ly not-one is-placed.
<verse style="v" number="42" />So, there, through the preparation of{the Judeans}, that the memorial has-been-being near, they-place the Jesus.</para>
  <chapter style="c" number="20" />
  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />Moreover, to{the one} of{the sabbaths}, Mary, the Magdalene, is-being-come early/morning still of{being darkness-ia} into the memorial and is-viewing the stone, having-been-lifted out of{the memorial}.
<verse style="v" number="2" />So, she-is-hurrying and is-being-come toward Simon Peter and toward the other disciple whom the Jesus has-been-being-fond-of, and she-is-saying to{same}, &quot;They-lift the Lord out of{the memorial} and we-have_not_beheld where[?] they-place same.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="3" />So, the Peter comes-out, and the other disciple, and they-have-been-being-come into the memorial.
<verse style="v" number="4" />Moreover, the two of{like} have-been-hurrying and the other disciple hurries-before more-speedily of{the Peter} and comes first into the memorial,
<verse style="v" number="5" />and, stoop[ing]-beside, he-is-viewing the linen-cloths being-lain. Nevertheless, he-does_not_come-into.
<verse style="v" number="6" />So, Simon Peter, accompanying to{same}, is-being-come, and comes-into into the memorial, and is-observing the linen-cloths being-lain
<verse style="v" number="7" />and the sudarium[Latin]/towel/napkin/cloth which has-been-being upon of{the head} of{same}, not alongside of{the linen-cloths}, being-lain; contrariwise, separate, having-been-enveloped into one place.
<verse style="v" number="8" />So, then also the other disciple, the come[ing] first, comes-into into the memorial and beholds and believes,
<verse style="v" number="9" />for not-moreover-yet-ly they-had-beheld the scripture, that it-is-necessitating same to-stand-up/anew out of{dead}.
<verse style="v" number="10" />So, again the disciples come-off/away toward sameselves.
<verse style="v" number="11" />Moreover, Mary had-stood toward the memorial outside, weeping. So, as she-has-been-weeping, she-stoops-beside into the memorial
<verse style="v" number="12" />and is-observing two messengers in to{white/bright} being-seat-ized, one toward to{the head} and one toward to{the feet}, which-where the body of{the Jesus} has-been-being-lain,
<verse style="v" number="13" />and the-there-s are-saying to{same}, &quot;Woman, what[?] you-are-weeping[?]&quot; She-is-saying to{same} that &quot;they-lift the Lord of{me} and I-have_not_beheld where[?] they-place same,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="14" />and, say[ing] the-same, she-is-turned into the behind and is-observing the Jesus having-stood, and she-had_not_beheld that he-is-being the Jesus.
<verse style="v" number="15" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Woman, what[?] you-are-weeping; who[?] you-are-seeking[?]&quot; The-there[feminine], esteeming that he-is-being the plantation-keeper, is-saying to{same}, &quot;lord, if you bear[weight] same, say to{me} where[?] you-place same and-I will-lift same.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="16" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Mary.&quot; Turned, the-there is-saying to{same} Hebrew-ly, &quot;Rabboni,&quot; which is-being-said, &quot;Teacher.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="17" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Do_not_be-taking-hold of{me}, for I-have_not-yet_ascended toward the Father of{me}; moreover, be-being-gone toward the brothers of{me} and say to{same}, &quot;I-am-ascending toward the Father of{me} and Father of{you}, and God of{me} and God of{you}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="18" />Mary, the Magdalene, is-being-come, messaging-off/away to{the disciples} that she-has-seen the Lord, and/also the-same [things] he-says to{same[feminine]}.
<verse style="v" number="19" />So, of{being late/evening} to{the day, the-there, the one} of{the sabbaths} and of{the doors having-been-closed}, which-where the disciples have-been-being having-been-gathered through the fear of{the Judeans}, the Jesus comes and stands into the midst, and is-saying to{same}, &quot;Peace to{you},&quot;
<verse style="v" number="20" />and, say[ing] the-same, he-shows to{same} the hands and the side of{same}. So, the disciples are-joyed, behold[ing] the Lord.
<verse style="v" number="21" />So, the Jesus says to{same} again, &quot;Peace to{you}. According-as the Father has-sent-off/away me, also-I am-dispatching you,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />and, say[ing] the-same, he-breathes/blows-in and is-saying to{same}, &quot;Take Holy Spirit.
<verse style="v" number="23" />Supposing of{any[plural]} you-may-let-off/away the sins, they-are-being-let-off/away to{same}; supposing of{any[plural]} you-may-be-holding, they-have-been-held.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="24" />Moreover, Thomas, one out of{the} twelve, the being-said &quot;Didymus,&quot; has_not_been-being alongside of{same[plural]} when the Jesus comes.
<verse style="v" number="25" />So, the other disciples have-been-saying to{same}, &quot;We-have-seen the Lord.&quot; Moreover, the says to{same}, if-supposing I-would_not_behold in to{the hands} of{same} the imprint of{the nails} and may-cast the finger of{me} into the imprint of{the nails} and may-cast the hand of{me} into the side of{same}, no, I-will_not_believe,&quot;
<verse style="v" number="26" />and alongside eight days again the disciples of{same} have-been-being within and Thomas alongside of{same}. The Jesus is-being-come of{the doors having-been-closed} and stands into the midst and says, &quot;Peace to{you}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="27" />Thereafter, he-is-saying to{the Thomas}, &quot;Be-carrying the finger of{you} here and behold the hands of{me}, and be-carrying the hand of{you} and cast into the side of{me}, and do_not_be-becoming unbelieving[adjective]; contrariwise, believing[adjective],&quot;
<verse style="v" number="28" />and Thomas responds and says to{same}, &quot;The Lord of{me} and the God of{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="29" />The Jesus is-saying to{same} that &quot;you-have-seen me; you-have-believed. Blessed, the not behold[ing] and believe[ing].&quot;
<verse style="v" number="30" />So, on-one-hand, the Jesus also does many other signs in-sight of{the disciples} of{same}, which is_not_being having-been-written in to{the scrollet, the-same};

  <para style="p"><verse style="v" number="1" />Alongside the-same, the Jesus reveals sameself again to{the disciples} upon of{the seawater, the Tiberias}. Moreover, he-reveals the-same-ly.
<verse style="v" number="2" />They-have-been-being of{like}, Simon Peter, and Thomas, the being-said &quot;Didymus,&quot; and Nathanael, the from Cana of{the Galilee}, and the[plural] of{the Zebedee}, and two others out of{the disciples} of{same}.
<verse style="v" number="3" />Simon Peter is-saying to{same}, &quot;I-am-withdrawing to-be-fishing.&quot; They-are-saying to{same}, &quot;We-are-being-come, and we together-with to{you}.&quot; They-come-out and step-in into the boat and in to{the-there, the night} grab-hold-of not-one/nothing.
<verse style="v" number="4" />Moreover, already of{early/morning become[ing]}, the Jesus stands into the shore. Nevertheless, the disciples had_not_beheld that it-is-being Jesus.
<verse style="v" number="5" />So, the Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Childlings, no what[?] you-are-having toward-eat[noun][?]&quot; They-respond to{same}, &quot;Not.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="6" />Moreover, the says to{same}, &quot;Cast the net into the right parts/portions of{the boat} and you-will-discover.&quot; So, they-cast and not-still they-have-strength to-pull same, from of{the multitude} of{the fishes}.
<verse style="v" number="7" />So, the disciple, the-there, whom the Jesus has-been-loving, is-saying to{the Peter}, &quot;It-is-being the Lord.&quot; So, Simon Peter, hear[ing] that it-is-being the Lord, through-girds the upon-clothing, for he-has-been-being naked, and casts sameself into the seawater.
<verse style="v" number="8" />Moreover, the other disciples come to{the small-boat}, for they-have_not_been-being far from of{the land}; contrariwise, as from of{two-hundred cubits}, dragging the net of{the fishes}.
<verse style="v" number="9" />So, as they-step-off into the land, they-are-viewing [a] charcoal/coal-ia[fire] being-lain, and side-portion-ie being-lain-upon, and bread.
<verse style="v" number="10" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Carry from of{the side-portion-ies which} you-grab-hold-of now.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="11" />So, Simon Peter ascends and pulls the net into the land replete of{[a] hundred fifty three large fishes}, and of{the-which-the-same being}, the net is_not_split.
<verse style="v" number="12" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Come! Have-breakfast/lunch.&quot; Moreover, not-one has-been-daring of{the disciples} to-examine-out same, &quot;You who[?] are-being,&quot; having-beheld that it-is-being the Lord.
<verse style="v" number="13" />So, the Jesus is-being-come and is-taking the bread and is-giving to{same}, and the side-portion-ie similarly.
<verse style="v" number="14" />Already the Jesus is-revealed to{the disciples} of{same} [the] third, the-same, roused out of{dead}.
<verse style="v" number="15" />So, when they-have-breakfast/lunch, the Jesus is-saying to{the Simon Peter}, &quot;Simon of{Jonah}, you-are-loving me much-more of{the-same[masculine plural]}[?]&quot; He-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Yes, Lord, you have-beheld that I-am-being-fond-of you.&quot; He-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Be-grazing the lambkins of{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="16" />He-is-saying to{same} again second[ly], &quot;Simon of{Jonah}, you-are-loving me[?]&quot; He-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Yes, Lord, you have-beheld that I-am-being-fond-of you. He-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Be-shepherding the sheep of{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="17" />He-is-saying to{same}, the third, &quot;Simon of{Jonah}, you-are-being-fond-of me[?]&quot; The Peter is-grieved that he-says to{same}, the third, &quot;You-are-being-fond-of me,&quot; and he-says to{same}, &quot;Lord, you have-beheld all. You are-knowing that I-am-being-fond-of you.&quot; The Jesus is-saying to{same}, &quot;Be-grazing the sheep of{me}.
<verse style="v" number="18" />Amen, amen I-am-saying to{you}, when you-have-been-being younger, you-have-been-girding yourself and have-been-walking-around which-where you-have-been-will-ing; moreover, when-supposing you-may-age, you-will-stretch-out the hands of{you} and another will-gird you, and will-carry which-where you-are_not_will-ing.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="19" />Moreover, he-says the-same signifying to{about-what-such death} he-will-esteem-ize/glorify the God and, say[ing] the-same, he-is-saying to{same}, &quot;Be-accompanying to{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="20" />Moreover, upon-turned, the Peter is-viewing the disciple whom the Jesus has-been-loving, accompanying, who also falls-up/anew in to{the dinner/supper} upon the chest/sternum of{same} and says, &quot;Lord, who[?] is-being the giving-aside/delivering you[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="21" />Behold[ing] the-same, the Peter is-saying to{the Jesus}, &quot;Lord, moreover, the-same[masculine], what[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="22" />The Jesus is-saying to{same}, if-supposing I-may-be-will-ing same to-be-staying until I-am-being-come, what[?] toward you[?] You, be-accompanying to{me}.&quot;
<verse style="v" number="23" />So, the-same, the word, comes-out into the brothers that the disciple, the-there, is_not_dying-off/away, and the Jesus does_not_say to{same} that he-is_not_dying-off/away; contrariwise, &quot;If-supposing I-may-be-will-ing same to-be-staying until I-am-being-come, what[?] toward you[?]&quot;
<verse style="v" number="24" />The-same is-being the disciple, the witnessing about of{the-same} and write[ing] the-same, and we-have-beheld that the witness-ia of{same} is-being true.
<verse style="v" number="25" />Moreover, it-is-being also many other as-many-as the Jesus does, the-which if-supposing it-may-be-being-written according-to one, not-moreover I-am-presuming-self same, the world, to-make-space, the being-written scrollets. Amen.</para></usx>
