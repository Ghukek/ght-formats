<verse style="v" number="3" />to{whom} also he-stands-beside[i.e. presents] sameself being-alive, alongside the to-suffer same, in to{many proofs} through of{forty days}, being-seen to{same[plural]} and saying the about of{the kingdom} of{the God},
<verse style="v" number="4" />and, being-amassed, he-messages-aside to{same} not to-be-being-separated from of{Jerusalems}; contrariwise, to-be-staying-around/about the message-upon-ia/declaration of{the Father}, &quot;which you-hear of{me},

<verse style="v" number="9" />and, say[ing] the-same, of{viewing same}, he-is-lifted-upon and [a] cloud takes-under same from of{the eyes} of{same},
<verse style="v" number="10" />and as they-have-been-being fixating into the heaven of{same being-gone}, also, behold, two men had-stood-beside to{same} in to{white/bright attire},
<verse style="v" number="11" />who also say, &quot;Men, Galileans, what[?] you-have-stood viewing-in into the heaven[?] The-same, the Jesus, the taken-up from of{you} into the heaven, the-same-ly will-be-come which manner you-spectate same being-gone into the heaven.&quot;

<verse style="v" number="4" />So, on-one-hand, the Festus responds to-be-being-kept, the Paul, in to{Caesarea}; on-the-other-hand, sameself to-be-being-about to-be-being-gone-out in to{speed}.
<verse style="v" number="5" />&quot;So, the[plural] enabled[adjective] in to{you},&quot; he-is-asserting, &quot;descend[ing]-together if what[?] is-being out-of-place in to{the man}, [they:] be-accusing of{same}.&quot;

<verse style="v" number="11" />So, on-one-hand, if I-am-doing-injustice/injuring and worthwhile of{death}, what[?] I-have-practiced, I-am_not_giving-cause/requesting-aside-self the to-die-off/away; on-the-other-hand, if nothing is-being of{which[plural]} the-same are-accusing of{me}, not-one is-being-enabled to-favor-ize me to{same[plural]}.
